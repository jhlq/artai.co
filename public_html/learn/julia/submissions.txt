Q1: 1.it is flexible,2.it provides a sophiscated compiler,3.it is familiar,4.is an object_oriented program,5.it provides ease and expressiveness for high_level numeric computing,6.it combines the features of imperative,7.it is functional,8.multiple dispatch,9.good performance,10.it provides a single environment productive enough for prototyping and efficient enough for deploying performance intensive applications
Q2: is used in conversation or meeting between two or more contents
Q3: are used to store values
Q4: integers are numbers that do not include decimal point eg 8,15 etc.while floating_point numbers are numbers that include decimal point eg 2.6,4.8 etc... 
Q5: operators are used to operate two or more operands examples of operators are:arithmetical operators(-,+,*,%,/).logical operators( AND,OR,NAND,NOR,XOR etc.bitwice(~,|,&,$,>>>,>>,<<).comparisions(==,!=,<,<=,>,>=)  )

Q1: complex numbers are results brought by  square root of a negative number where it has imaginary part that includes 'i' and a real part that consists of only constant numbers from 0 to 9 eg sqrt of neg 4 results 2i+2 and -2i-2,It makes writing polynomial expressions much cleaner
Q2: strings are made from the squence of characters. Note that characters are(A,B,C,D..........Z)Eg of making a string 'M','A','H'.,'O','R','O' the string from these characters is MAHORO
Q3: function is an object that maps a tuple of argument values to a return value
Q4: it allows portions of code to be evaluated depending on the value of a boolean expression
Q5: a scope is a region of code within which variable is visible

Q1: 1.types are used to generate codes,2. helps method to dispatch,3.they allow program expression to execute
Q2: types allow method dispatch on the types of function arguments to be deeply integrated with the language and the method is rooted in type system
Q3: constructors are functions that construct objects especially instances of composite types
Q4: conversion: under performance of convert function the conversion of values to various types occurs while promotion refers to convert values of mixed types to a single common type
Q5: 1.end_module allows to create top_level definitions without warrying about name conflicts when your code is used together with somebody else's._ Within a module you can control which names from other modules are visible(via import)and specific which of your names are intended to be public(via export)

Q1: metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs that write or manipulate other programs or themselves as their data
Q2: an array is a collection of objects stored in a multi_dimensional grid
Q3: a matrix is a combination of rows and columns within an array 
Q4: 1.no need of underlying a synchroneous operation,2. text i/o values do not get converted to any canoncical text representation,4.with basic streams all julia streams expose atleast a read and a write method,taking the stream as their first argument.5. with resolving ip address streams are used to do appropriate address resolution,6. with simple tcp the method names feels familiar other kinds of servers 
Q5: your code must be available on any process that runs it.

Q1: it borrows backtick notation for commands from the shell,perl and ruby
Q2: 1.it makes good use of codes 2.through most codes can be written in julia there are many high_quality 3.functions can be called directly from julia without any glue code,code generation or compilation even from interactive prompt
Q3: by using non_interactive pkg.add command or youa can use pkg.add function
Q4: grobal names are frequently constants,and declaring them as such greatly improves performance
Q5: 1. it avoids errors than to rely on catching, 2.it helps compiler to annotate specific uses than to try to pack many alternatives into one type,3.it does not accept numbers of all types

Q1: multiple dispatch is the feature of some object_oriented programming languages in which a function or method can be dynamically dispatched based on the runtime type of more than of its arguments
Q2: to give it as a first argument to the julia command
Q3: names of variables are in lower_case work separation can be indicated by underscores but use of underscore is discouraged unless the name would be hard to read or otherwise
Q4: overflow is the exceeding maximum representable value of a given type result
Q5: "a=1" means that 1 assigns to a, while "a==1" means a equals to 1

Q1: comprex(a,b) it avoids multiplication and addition operators
Q2: unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding,representation and handling of text expressed in most of word's writing systems
Q3: it causes a function to return immediately providing an expression whose value is returned
Q4: are good for executing conditioned statements
Q5: the function turns the value of the grobal if there were a such variable or produce an error if no such grobal existed

Q1: 1.UPDATING OPERATORS: Assigns The Result Of The Operation Back Into Its Left Oparand.The Updating Version Of Binary Operator Is Formed By Placing a= Immediately After The Operator.EXAMPLE: X+=3 Equivalent To X=+3   2.BITWICE OPERATORS:Operate On One Or More Bit Patterns Or Binary Numerals At The Level Of Their Individual Bits.It Is a Fast, Primitive Action Directly Supported By Processor And Is Used To Manipulate Values For Comparisions And Calculations. Examples: B.Not, B.And, B.Or, B.Xor   3.ARITHEMATICAL OPERATOR:Is The Oldest And Most Elimentary Branch Of Mathematics, It Consists In Study Of Numbers Especially The Properties Of Traditional Operations Between Them.EXAMPLES: Addition,substraction, Multiplication And Division.
Q2: PARAMETRIC METHODS:Are Defined Methods Optionally Have Type Parameters Immediately After The Method Name And Before The Parameter Tuple
Q3: INNER CONSTRUCTOR METHOD:Is a Constructor Method That Enforces Invariants And Allows Construction Of Self_referential Object After The Failure Of Outer Constructor Method.
Q4: Julia>x=12    Julia>type(x)   Julia>type Of(ans) Juia>convert(floating Point;x)   Julia>type Of(ans) 
Q5: MAIN: Is The Top_level Module, And Julia Starts With Main Set As The Current Module.Variables Defined At The Prompt Go In Main And Who S<>lists Variables In Main   CORE: Contains All Identifiers Considered "built In" To The Language i.e Part Of The Core Language And Not Libraries Every Module Implicitly Specifies Using Core Since You Can Not Do Anything Without Those Definitions    BASE: Is The Standard Library (the Contents Of Base/).All Modules Implicity Contain Using Base Since This Is Needed In The Vast Majority Of Cases.

Q1: Macros Allow Program To Automatically Generate Expressions By Transforming Zeros Or More Argument Expressions Into a Single Result Expression, Which Then Takes The Place Of Macro Call In The Final Syntax Tree
Q2: By Replacating The Vector To The Size Of The Matrix
Q3: Scalar Indexing And Assignment,   2.Insertion Of Non Zeros Values One At a Time In CSC Structure Tend To Be Slow
Q4: A TCP: Transmission Control Protocol, It Is Used To Get Data From One Network Device To An Other.
Q5: 1.@spawn Macro Makes Things Easier , It Operates On An Expression Rather Than a Function And Picks Where To Do The Operation For You.3. It Also Makes Data But This Is Not As Obvious Hence It Can Be Called An Implicit Data Movement Operation.4.It Also Used To Flip Coins On Two Processes.5. It Limits The Parallelism To Two Processes

Q1: The run methoditself returns nothing, andthrows an ErrorException ifthe external command failsto run successfully.
Q2: A tuple of input types, like those allowed for the return type. The input types must be written as a literal tuple, not a tuple- valued variable or expression. Return type, which may be any bits type, including Int32, Int64, Float64, or Ptr{T} for any type parameter T, indicating a pointer to values of type T, or Ptr {Void} for void* “untyped pointer” values.

Q3: Names of variables arein lower case.
Q4:  In Julia overflow is the exceeding of  the maximum representable value of a given type results in a wraparound behavior:
