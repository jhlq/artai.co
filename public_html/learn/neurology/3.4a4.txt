Presynaptic inhibition can be mediated by many different types of metabotropic receptors (including GABA receptors), which often inhibit calcium channels or the exocytotic release machinery. This causes a decrease in neurotransmitter release probability. In the mammalian brain, presynaptic inhibition is not mediated by axo-axonic synapses, which are only thought to exist in the spinal cord.
