The length constant is a parameter that is used to quantify the distance that a voltage will extend across an axon or dendrite at steady state. The greater the value of the length constant, the further the voltage will spread and vice versa. The voltage attenuation along the length of a cylindrical cable is governed by an exponential decay function with this length constant. In particular, if you have a length constant of 1 mm, that means at 1 mm away from the cell body in an axon, 37% of the voltage remains at steady state.
