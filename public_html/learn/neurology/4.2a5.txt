EPSPs are larger in amplitude and shorter in time course, when they are measured close to their site of generation in a dendrite. The large local membrane potential associated with a dendritic EPSP is caused by the high local membrane resistance (small leak conductance relative to the glutamate-gated conductance) and the small local capacitance (due to the small membrane area of thin dendrites). The local membrane potential is only briefly depolarised by a very large amount in the dendrite, because axial currents then rapidly spread the depolarisation. The axial currents are filtered by membrane capacitance and leak conductances. If we record simultaneously from a dendrite and a soma, we see a big fast EPSP in the dendrite, and a small slow EPSP in the soma.
