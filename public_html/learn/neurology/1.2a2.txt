The phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane is highly impermeable to ions and charged molecules. The membrane is highly permeable to small non-polar uncharged molecules, like gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide,nitrogen). The permeability of the membrane to polar (water soluble) molecules is very low. The transport of most molecules and ions across the plasma membrane is enabled by specific membrane proteins, which are embedded into the cell membrane.
