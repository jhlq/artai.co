Post-tetanic potentiation can be induced at some synapses in the mammalian brain by a brief (1 s) 100 Hz train of presynaptic action potentials. The calcium influx activates protein kinase C, which phosphorylates MUNC18 and increases neurotransmitter release probability for ~1 minute. Post-tetanic potentiation only depends upon presynaptic firing and is independent of postsynaptic activity.
