Even if the membrane potential is actually close to the reversal potential of Cl-, GABA-A mediated inhibition can still make a significant impact on the integration of excitatory synaptic inputs. GABA-A Cl- conductance will increase membrane conductance and thus decrease the membrane resistance. Excitatory synaptic input arriving across the dendritic arborisations will thus be subjected to more leaky dendrites and a more leaky soma, thus causing smaller changes in membrane potential.
