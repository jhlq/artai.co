The length constant of a cylindrical cable dendrite is given by the square root of the membrane resistance divided by the axial resistance for a given length of dendrite.

The membrane resistance for a given length of dendrite is generally given in units of Ohm.m (the longer the dendrite, the lower the membrane resistance).

The axial resistance for a given length of dendrite is generally given in units of Ohm/m (the longer the dendrite, the greater the axial resistance).

The voltage attenuation at steady state across the length of the dendritic cable is described by an exponential decay with this length constant.
