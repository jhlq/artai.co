Calcium influx into the presynaptic bouton evoked by an action potential, drives fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. This is typically an all-or-none event with a single vesicle being released or no vesicle being released. Each synaptic vesicle is filled with a high concentration of neurotransmitter and the exocytosis of a synaptic vesicle therefore causes the release of a quantum a neurotransmitter.
