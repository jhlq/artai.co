Dopamine is thought to signal reward prediction error and is therefore a useful learning signal. If a reward is correctly predicted, there is nothing to learn, the brain already knows what is going on and there is no need to change behavioral strategy. Dopamine firing rates increase transiently at the time when things get better than expected, and the dopamine signal might therefore be useful to tell the brain that it should try to figure out what led to the improvement. Unexpected reward or unexpected sensory cues that predict upcoming reward are good at increasing firing rates in dopaminergic neurons.
