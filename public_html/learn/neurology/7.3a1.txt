In reward-based learning the idea is to learn that in a specific stimulus context we should perform a specific motor output that will then lead to a reward. In this type of learning the animal needs to learn to transform sensory inputs into meaningful motor outputs. Reward-based learning likely strengthens the synaptic circuits linking the specific sensory input and the rewarded motor output. However, not all learning relies upon reward signals - there are many other forms of learning in the brain.
