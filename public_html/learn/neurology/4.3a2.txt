Mechanogated sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia or trigeminal ganglia signal tactile information. They release glutamate at synapses in brainstem, exciting postsynaptic neurons, which in turn send glutamatergic signals to postsynaptic neurons in the thalamus. Retinal ganglion cells receive visual information through glutamatergic synapses from retinal bipolar cells, which are excited by glutamate released from retinal photoreceptors. The retinal ganglion cells in turn release glutamate onto postsynaptic thalamic neurons. Vision and touch are processed in separate parts of the thalamus, ventrobasal (VB) thalamus for touch and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus for vision. The VB sends glutamatergic signals to the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex for tactile perception and the LGN projecs glutamatergic axons to the primary visual (V1) cortex for visual perception.
