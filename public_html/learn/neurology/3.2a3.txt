The synaptic vesicle with a diameter of around 40 nanometers is brought into close apposition with the plasma membrane through the action of three important proteins that form the SNARE complex. It is composed of synaptobrevin which is a so-called vesicular SNARE; syntaxin, which is a plasma membrane SNARE; and SNAP-25 that's closely associated to syntaxin.
