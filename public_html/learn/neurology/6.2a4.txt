If man's brain is a thousand times larger than the mouse brain, and the neurons in man and mouse have similar connectivity with 1,000 other neurons, then man's brain would have 1 thousand times more synapses.

Man: 100,000,000,000 * 1,000 = 10^14

Mouse: 100,000,000 * 1,000 = 10^11

The ratio of the number of different patterns of connectivity is however much larger.
