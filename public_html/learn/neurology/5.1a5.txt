GABA-B receptors, which are metabotropic, first have to activate G-proteins before the associated ion channels can be opened. This takes more time than directly opening the ion channel of the GABA-A receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel, thus opening within milliseconds. Once activated, the GABA-B receptor causes a long-lasting postsynaptic conductance (several hundred milliseconds), whereas the GABA-A mediated conductance only lasts tens of milliseconds.
