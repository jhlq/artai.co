Benzodiazepines do not directly activate GABA-A receptors on their own, but only potentiate GABA-evoked currents. In particular, they increase the affinity of GABA-A receptors for binding GABA. Benzodiazepines potentiate GABA-A receptors containing the a1, a2, a3 or a5 subunits, but have no effect on a4 and a6 subunits.
