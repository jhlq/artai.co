When the pipette contacts the neuron we remove the pressure and suck gently to attach to the cell. The observed current flow drops dramatically during the process, which means the resistance between the pipette and the extracellular space increases. It is good to have this resistance in the order of Giga ohms to be able to have good recordings. When the seal resistance is in the order of Giga ohms, it is called a giga-seal.
