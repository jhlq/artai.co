The GABA neurotransmitter is synthesized in a single enzymatic step, where glutamate is treated by the GAD enzyme producing GABA. The GABA neurotransmitter is packaged into synaptic vesicles through a protein called the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). The concentration of GABA neurotransmitter inside a vesicle is about 100 mM (not 100 nM). GABA is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, whereas in the spinal cord and the brainstem the main inhibitory neurotransmitter is glycine.
