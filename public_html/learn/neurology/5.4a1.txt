An incoming sensory signal causes glutamateric excitation of thalamic projection neurons. The thalamic projection neurons are glutamatergic and excite neurons in the cortex and in the nucleus reticularis (NRT). NRT neurons are inihibtory GABAergic neurons, which reciprocally innervate the main thalamic nuclei. That means that the axon of the NRT neurons comes back and innervates the area from where it received excitation (and typically also other regions). Therefore, there is a feedback inhibition right onto the cells that initially were excited.
