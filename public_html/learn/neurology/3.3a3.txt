Short-term facilitation results from the accumulation of Ca2+ within the presynaptic terminal during high frequency action potential firing. The calcium influx from a recent action potential can cause saturation of calcium buffers and thus the next action potential can evoke a larger peak calcium concentration in the presynaptic bouton. Because neurotransmitter release depends steeply upon calcium concentration, this drives higher release rates.
