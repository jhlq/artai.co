Short-term depression results, at least in part, from the depletion of release-ready synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic bouton. During repetitive action potential firing, synaptic vesicles are released and it takes time for new synaptic vesicles to dock and become release-ready. The number of available vesicles for release therefore decreases, causing a drop in release probability.
