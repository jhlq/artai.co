An action potential evokes neurotransmitter release from an individual presynaptic bouton in a quantal probabilistic manner. If the two neurons are synaptically connected by a single low release probability bouton, then the postsynaptic resonse will be highly variable. On the other hand if two neurons are connected by many reliable synaptic boutons, then the postsynaptic response will have low variance.
