A large amount of glutamatergic input in the striatum comes from the neocortex. Dopamine seems to have two opposing actions on cortical input to the striatum. The action of dopamine in the context of the glutamatergic synapses is on the D1 receptors to promote the insertion of both AMPA and NMDA receptors onto the postsynaptic membranes. D1 receptor activation appears to be essential for promoting long-term potentiation, and cortical input onto the D1 striatal projection neurons appears to be potentiated by the action of dopamine. Therefore, a strengthening of the direct pathway occurs in the presence of reward. On the other hand, the activation of D2 receptors from dopamine seems to be involved in the opposite type of synaptic plasticity. In particular, activation of D2 receptors prevents calcium entry through the NMDA receptor, inducing long-term depression at the synapse. Thus, dopamine acting upon D2 receptors suppresses cortical input to the striatum and gives rise to long-term depression onto the indirect striatal projection neurons.
