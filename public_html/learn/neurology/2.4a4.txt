The action potential in this example is said to have a duration of 1 ms, when measured at a single point on the neuronal arborisation. The action potential propagation speed is said to be 1 m/s in the example axon. The action potential moves along the axon generating a sequence of depolarisation and repolarisation. The total extent of the depolarisation is roughly given by the duration of the depolarisation (1 ms = 0.001 s) times the speed of the action potential (1 m/s). This gives a length of 1 mm being depolarised across the overall length of the axonal cable at any given moment in time. The location of this 1 mm segment that is depolarised changes as the action potential moves along the axon.
