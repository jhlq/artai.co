In the mammalian brain, presynaptic neuromodulation typically results from the activation of metabotropic receptors for many different types of neurotransmitters (including acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA). Ionotropic receptors are not usually involved (although there is evidence that presynaptic NMDA receptors can play a regulatory role, and in the spinal cord there are direct GABAergic synapses on presynaptic terminals).
