Neuronal arborisations typically span more than 100 um. Given the scattering of light and the size of neurons, it is not reasonabe to expect to resolve spatial signals localised on a length scale smaller than ~100 um. Neuronal activity typically works on the milliscond timescale (an action potential is ~1 millisecond in duration and synaptic potentials are tens ~10 ms in duration). It therefore seems reasonable to hope for ~1 ms time-resolution.
