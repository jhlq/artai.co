Sensory percepts result from interactions between incoming sensory information and learned stimulus associations from previous experiences. Sensory percepts are learned through experience. The reason we recognize objects is because we've seen many closely related images before and from many different angles. Sensory perception is an active process in at least two different ways. Firstly, motor control is very important for sensory perception, as we actively gather sensory information by making voluntary movements. For example, we make eye and head movements to see specific parts of the visual field, or we move our hands and fingers to touch objects so as to actively get tactile sensory information. Secondly, sensory perception is an active process in another way, in which our neuronal activity can actively generate our sensory percepts. As such, sensory percepts are subjective, and this can easily be understood by looking at images that evoke alternating percepts. One can therefore not claim that percepts are independent of the observer, since they are actually generated by the internal activity of the brain.
