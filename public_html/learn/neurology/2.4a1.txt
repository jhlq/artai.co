The all-or-none action potential is the main way in which information is transmitted across the entire extent of a neuron including dendrites and axons. In most respects the amount of information could be equally well (or better) encoded through graded subthreshold potentials. However, in terms of transmitting this information over long distances, the all-or-none action potential is advantageous because it can be amplified and propagated in a loss-free manner (in the same way that digital communication technologies are now used extensively in modern society).
