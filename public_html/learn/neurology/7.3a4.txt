The striatum contains at least two types of GABAergic striatal projection neurons, which can be differentiated not only in terms of the type of dopamine receptor they express, but also in terms of their apparent function. In particular, D1R- and D2R-expressing striatal projection neurons exert opposing effects upon the SNr. The direct pathway, which involves D1R-expressing projection neurons, directly innervates and inhibits SNr. On the other hand, the indirect pathway that involves D2R-expressing projection neurons, innervates and inhibits the GPe, which in turn inhibits SNr. Therefore, the more inhibition that GPe receives from the D2 striatal projection neurons, the less inhibition it sends to the SNR. Thus, the indirect striatal projection neurons induce a disinhibitory effect that leads to an increase of the SNr firing. SNr contains tonically active GABAergic neurons, that at least in part serve to inhibit motor ouput. Inhibiting SNr, therefore allows motor output, forming a 'go' sigal. Disinhibition of SNr, will contribute to stronger suppression motor output, forming a 'no go' signal.
