Some forms of synaptic plasticity (like LTP) require the correlated, simultaneous activity of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The strengthening of their connections is thus an associative plasticity. Other forms of synaptic plasticity only depend upon the pattern of activity of the either the presynaptic or the postsynaptic activity (but not their correlated activity). Such forms of plasticity are therefore not associative.
