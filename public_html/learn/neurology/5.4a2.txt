Feedback inhibition provides a graded amount of inhibition depending upon the level of excitation. It thus balances excitation, and prevents over-excitation. Feedback inhibition also helps select strong inputs, because the cells receiving weaker excitation will be inhibited by the slightly delayed feedback inhibition. This in turn contributes to the sharpening of neuronal receptive fields, because the cells can only fire if they are strongly excited within a short-time interval, otherwise feedback inhibition will prevent action potential firing.
