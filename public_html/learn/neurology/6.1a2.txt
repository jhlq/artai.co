Individual cells have small length scales (microns) and require high-resolution measuring techniques in order to resolve their individual activities in the living mammalian brain. EEG and MEG signals are measured outside of the brain and cannot distinguish the activity of different cells. fMRI and PET typically have spatial resolutions in the millimeter range and thus also fail to resolve cellular activity. Small tipped electrodes, like whole-cell pipettes and many other types of extracellular electrodes, resolve the activity of individual neurons. High resolution-optical techniques also resolve structure and function on the micron scale and can thus provide cellular information.
