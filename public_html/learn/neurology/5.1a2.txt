Most synapses in the brain are glutamatergic, accounting for about 80% of the total number synapses. If there were only glutamatergic excitation in the neuronal networks of the brain, then there would be excessive activity and all the neurons would be continuously active. Therefore, there is a need for inhibition to balance the excitation, which is provided by GABAergic neurons. GABA acts upon postsynaptic neurons preventing them from firing action potentials. GABAergic neurons have high specificity in terms of function and location of synapses in the neuronal network.
