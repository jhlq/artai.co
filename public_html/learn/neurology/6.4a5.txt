Layer 2/3 neocortical GABAergic neurons represent roughly 10% of the layer 2/3 neuronal population, and fire at ~10 times higher rates than excitatory pyramidal neurons, which make up 90% of the layer 2/3 neuronal population. The time-averaged total number of action potentials in excitatory neurons is therefore about the same as the total in the much smaller number of GABAergic neurons.
