Each subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel has six transmembrane regions (S1-S6). S4 is the voltage sensing region. It is the transmembrane alpha helix that can readily move in the ion channel. It is full of arginine amino acids that have a positive charge on them. The ability of the S4 region to be mobile and it's positive charge, allows it to interact with the electric field across the plasma membrane. The movement of the S4 region under the influence of the electric field couples to the open probability for a voltage-gated sodium channel.
