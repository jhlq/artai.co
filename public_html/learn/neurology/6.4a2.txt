With in vivo whole-recordings, we gain access to the inside of the cell and can observe subthreshold as well as suprathreshold membrane potential events. A large part of the membrane potential fluctuations are driven by synaptic inputs, which are typically small in amplitude. These events can be resolved with the whole-cell recording technique. Through the whole-cell recording technique, one can therefore begin to investigate the neuronal computation transforming synptic input into action potential output. Injecting currents allows perturbations of single cell function to be made, and also helps in the biophysical analysis of conductances. Dye filling of the recorded neurons is also important to distinguish cell-types and brain locations of the recorded neurons.

However, in vivo whole-cell recordings are technically difficult to obtain, and extracellular measurements are much easier to carry out. The robustness of extracellular recordings has allowed high density recording electrodes to become useful tools in neuroscience.
