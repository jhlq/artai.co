Inactivation of the C2 barrel column with TTX or CNQX/APV tests for the necessity of neuronal activity, but not sufficiency. Optogenetic stimulation experiments test sufficiency. Specifically and directly driving the activity of the neurons in the C2 barrel column to evoke licking demonstrates that the action potential firing in these neurons is sufficient to drive motor output. However, this is presumably evoked by communicating with downstream neurons, and thus S1 is a node in a complex sensorimotor loop.
