Presynaptic inhibition causes a decrease in the probability of releasing synaptic vesicles. The first effect is therefore to reduce the efficacy of synaptic transmission evoked by single action potentials. However, during repetitive action potential firing, there is an interesting interaction with the mechanisms of short-term plasticity. Because the first action potential releases less neurotransmitter during presynaptic inhibition, there are more release-ready vesicles remaining than normally when the second action potential in a train arrives. Thus there will be less synaptic depression and facilitation can occur.
