All of the above are correct. The equilibrium potential for an ion is the membrane potential at which there is no net movement of that ion across the membrane because the movement of ions due to a concentration gradient is equal but opposite to the movement due to the electrical gradient. The resting membrane potential of neurons is largely determined by potassium leak conductances (but also with significant contribution of other conductances e.g. chloride).
