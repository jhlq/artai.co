Ion channels typically open and close stochastically on the microsecond timescale. The open probability of the voltage-gated ion channels is a complex function depending upon both membrane potential and the recent history of activity. The change in open probability of ion channels is typically regulated on a slower time scale than each individual opening and closing event of the ion channels.
