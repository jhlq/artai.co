The concept of two-photon excitation is based on the idea that two photons of comparably lower energy than needed for single-photon excitation can also excite a fluorophore. Each photon carries approximately half the energy necessary to excite the molecule. An excitation results in the subsequent emission of a fluorescence photon, typically at a higher energy than either of the two excitatory photons. The probability of the near-simultaneous absorption of two photons is low, and depends on the square of the photon density. As a consequence, two-photon excitation occurs only in the small volume where the laser beam is focused, and not in the entire light cone. Therefore, all the emitted fluorescence photons originate from this volume, thus providing useful signal. Additionally, the localisation of excitation induces less photodamage to the tissue, which is crucial for long-term imaging.
