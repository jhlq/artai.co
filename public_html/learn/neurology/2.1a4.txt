The single channel conductance of sodium channels is ~20 pS. The input resistance of a typical neuron at rest is around 50 Mohm and thus the total membrane conductance of a typical neuron is ~20 nS. In order to make a major impact on the membrane potential, the total conductance of sodium channels should be around 20 nS. To establish that, approximately 1000 channels need to open.
