The conductance of NMDA receptors activated by glutamate is strongly reduced at hyperpolarized potentials (more negative than ~-50 mV) under physiological conditions. The reason of this voltage-dependence is different than the voltage-gated sodium/potassium/calcium channels. The NMDA receptors aren't intrinsically voltage-sensitive, but they gain that attribute because of a magnesium block. Magnesium ions enter the NMDA receptor channel pore at negative potentials, interacting with pore-lining amino acid residues and blocking the NMDA receptors. The magnesium ions induce a fast flickering block, as they stochastically enter and leave the ion channel pore. When the cell depolarizes, the magnesium is repelled from the internal binding site by the electric field and the NMDA receptor can fully conduct.
