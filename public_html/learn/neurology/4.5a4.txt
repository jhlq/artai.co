Calcium rises can occur in spines through activation of NMDA receptors, voltage-gated calcium channels and release of calcium from intracellular stores. It can be difficult for Ca2+ ions to diffuse out of the spine head, because the spine neck can be very small in diameter (~100 nm). This means that Ca2+ signals can be localized to a single dendritic spine, which then might help synaptic plasticity to remain synapse-specific. The spine neck can be so thin that it might offer giga-Ohm resistance, which could significantly filter glutamatergic signalling. However, spines are not rigid unchanging structures, rather they are highly dynamic.
