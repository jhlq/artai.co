C = 10 pF

e = 1.6 x 10^-19 C

In order to calculate the number of the ions, first we need to know how much charge would need to change the membrane potential by 70 mv:

Q = C x V

= 10 x 10^-12 F x 70 x 10^-3 V

= 0.7 pC -> the charge

For the number of ions:

Q = Number of ions x e

Q = 0.7 pC

e = 1.6 x 10^-19 C

Q/e -> gives the number of ions

Q/e = 0.7 x 10^-12 C / 1.6 x 10^-19 C

Q/e = ~4 million ions
