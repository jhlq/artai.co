Both AMPA and NMDA receptors are permeable to sodium and potassium ions. NMDA receptors are also calcium permeable. AMPA receptors are typically not calcium permeable (except if they lack GluA2 receptors). NMDA receptors need glycine / D-serine as a co-agonist to glutamate in order to get activated. AMPA and NMDA receptors are both cation channels with a reversal potential of ~0 mV. The single channel conductance of AMPA receptors is ~5 pS, whereas the NMDA receptor has ~10 times bigger single channel conductance of ~50 pS.
