Approximately 80% of the synapses in the mammalian brain use the neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate-gated cation channels (ionotropic glutamate receptors) increase their open probability in response to glutamate. Under physiological conditions, they typically have a reversal potential close to 0 mV, which depolarises most neurons (which typically have resting membrane potentials ~-70 mV). The 0 mV reversal potential is also more depolarised than action potential threshold (which is typically ~-45 mV) and activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors therefore increases action potential firing probability. That firing rate increases, defines glutamate as an excitatory neurotransmitter.
