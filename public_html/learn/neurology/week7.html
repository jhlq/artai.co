<p><h3>Question 7.1.2 </h3></p>
<p>Increases in cytosolic calcium concentration in muscle cells cause contraction. How do these calcium signals come about in skeletal muscle?
<ul><li>Nicotinic receptors are activated postsynaptically causing an influx of cations into the muscle and action potential firing in the muscle.
