Muscles are innervated by motor neurons. At the neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine activates postsynaptic ligand-gated ion channels, which are called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This causes an influx of cations, most importantly sodium ions, which in turn causes a postsynaptic depolarization of the muscle. The muscle gets depolarized and fires an action potential, which propagates along the muscle cell and throughout the complex membrane invaginations of the T-tubules. The depolarisation activates voltage-gated calcium channels, which signal through a protein-protein interaction with ryanodine receptors to activate calcium release from intracellular calcium stores (the sarcoplasmic reticulum).
