Opening voltage-gated potassium channels will always hyperpolarise a typical neuron under normal physiological conditions. The opening of potassium channels will drive the membrane potential towards the potassium reversal potential (but not necessarily reaching it - this depends upon what other conductances are open). The potassium reversal potential is the most negative of all the physiological ions and therefore increasing this conductance always causes hyperpolarisation.
