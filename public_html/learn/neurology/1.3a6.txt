Selectivity is a preference of the channel to conduct a specific ion. There are different classes of selective ion channels, e.g. sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca+) and chloride (Cl-). The degree of selectivity can vary between different members of the same class and there are also many types of non-selective channels. Ion channels are, almost invariably, at least selective for either positive ions (cations) or negative ions (anions).
