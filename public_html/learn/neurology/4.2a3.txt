Let us consider an EPSC dominated by AMPA synaptic currents having ~2 ms of duration in response to presynaptic release of glutamate. When the AMPA conductance closes, that is the end of the EPSC (EPSCs are measured in voltage-clamp, therefore there is no charging of the membrane capacitance). But for an EPSP we need to consider the charging and discharging of the membrane capacitance. During the synaptic conductance a lot of charge entered the cell, changing the membrane potential and charging the membrane capacitance. The decay phase of the EPSP is determined by the discharge of membrane capacitance through the leak conductances. The membrane time constant depends on capacitance and leak conductance, and is typically on the order of tens of miliseconds for mammalian neurons. This is the difference between EPSCs (which have rapid time-courses) and EPSPs (which are much slower and longer-lasting, being filtered by the membrane capacitance).
