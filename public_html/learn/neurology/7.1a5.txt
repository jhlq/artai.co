Optogenetic ChR2 stimulation of excitatory neurons in the primary whisker somatosensory cortex causes the contralateral whiskers to move backwards (retraction), and remain retracted for as long as the stimulus is delivered. If we imagine a whisker impinging upon a surface as the mouse advances towards an object, then the retraction of the whisker will tend to reduce whisker-object contact and thus reduce the bending of whiskers, giving rise to smaller sensory signals (which may be more refined). The motor activity associated with S1 driving whisker retraction could thus be viewed as a negative feedback signal.

Stimulation of whisker motor cortex (wM1) causes the contralateral whiskers to move forwards rhythmically (exploratory rhythmic protraction). An exploring mouse will scan the space immediately surrounding its snout by rhythmically moving its whiskers backwards and forwards. If there is an objected located in the trajectory of the whiskers, it will cause the whiskers to bend, generating forces in the whisker follicle and driving action potential firing in sensory neurons. Stimulation of wM1 might therefore enhance the flow of incoming sensory whisker information.
