In STDP, if the postsynaptic cell often fires an action potential ~10-100 ms before the presynaptic cell fires an action potential, then a reduction in the EPSP amplitude occurs through long-term synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, if the presynaptic cell often fires an action potential 10-50 ms before the postsynaptic cell fires an action potential, then an increase in the EPSP amplitude occurs through long-term synaptic plasticity.
