In order to investigate the causal mechanisms of brain function and behavior, there are three important steps that we need to make. First, we need to measure in detail the activity of specific cells, and correlate this with behavior. Then, in order to reach causality, we need to perturb the activity of specific cells within the brain during behavior. Finally, we need to quantitatively model the causal interactions driving brain function and behavior.
