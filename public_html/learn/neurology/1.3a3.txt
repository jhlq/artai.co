The ion channel pore is where ions can cross from one side of the membrane to the other. The ion channel pore is largely aqueous allowing ions to diffuse freely into the ion channel. Ions in solution are surrounded by water molecules, that is they are hydrated. That ions do not need to dehydrate in order to permeate the ion channel allows fast transport of ions.
