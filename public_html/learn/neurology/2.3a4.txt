Action potential threshold is the membrane potential above which an action potential is initiated. The depolarising upstroke of the action potential depends upon the rapid recruitment of voltage-gated sodium channels. They must rapidly drive the membrane potential to positive values, otherwise they will inactivate and thus fail to initiate the action potential. The sodium channels also need to be rapidly activated because the upstroke of the action potential must be completed before the delayed potassium conductance begins to act. The initiation of an action potential at the action potential threshold is therefore determined by the need for the voltage-dependent increase in sodium current to outpace the increase in potassium current over a sufficiently long period to drive the upstroke of the action potential.
