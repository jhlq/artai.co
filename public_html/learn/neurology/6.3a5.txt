If we imagine that the continuous power output laser gives rise to a certain amount of fluorescence, then the pulsed laser (100 fs @ 100 MHz) will result in 100,000 times as much fluorescence. Two-photon fluorescence depends upon the square of the photon density in time and space. If the the time-averaged power is the same but divided into brief pulses, then the peak powers are much higher in the pulsed case. The 100 fs pulses that occur every 10 ns, result in excitation photons being compressed into 0.001% of the total time, giving rise to 100,000 times larger peak powers. Because the fluorescence depends upon the square of the photon density, the fluorescence is 10^10 times larger. However, it only occurs 0.001% of the total time, and thus the average fluoresence increase resulting from this pulsed laser is 100,000 times compared to a continuous laser with the same average power output.
