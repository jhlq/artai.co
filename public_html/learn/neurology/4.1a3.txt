Following a millisecond pulse of glutamate, AMPA receptors increase open probability within ~1 ms, but it takes some time before the NMDA current maximizes (~20 ms). This is long after the glutamate has already gone, and NMDA receptor currents can remain active for hundreds of miliseconds after a glutamate pulse. Thus, the temporal kinetics of AMPA conductance and NMDA conductance are extremely different. NMDA receptors have one or two orders of magnitude slower activity, compared to the extremely fast AMPA receptors.
