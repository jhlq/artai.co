The main problem with testing hypotheses is the incompleteness of the obtained data. Some experimental data might be consistent with a hypothesis, but perhaps further experiments will contradict the hypothesis. There are always more experiments to do! Scientific progress is therefore a continuous process of updating our best hypotheses and subjecting them to rigorous experimental tesing.
