The time constant is a parameter that provides information about how fast the membrane potential changes in response to current injection. It is defined through the exponential charging of the membrane capacitance equation, as the amount of time it takes for the change in potential to reach 63% of its final steady state value. The lower the time constant, the faster the change of in voltage. The time constant is a function of two membrane properties, the membrane resistance and membrane capacitance. The lower the membrane resistance and membrane capacitance, the faster the membrane time constant.
