Since the recording electrode in this configuration is located "extracellularly" we can only observe changes in potentials in the extracellular field. Action potentials are massive membrane potential fluctuations, which are driven by strong transmembrane currents over a very short time scale. The flux of sodium and potassium ions in the extracellular space can be detected with a nearby electrode. Therefore it is possible to record these 'spike' events (action potentials) extracellularly.
