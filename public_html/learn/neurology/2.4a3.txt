Specialised glial cells (oligodendrocytes in the central and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system) wrap very thin processes around selected axons. Since the myelin processes contain 80% lipid, it is a good electrical insulator. It increases axonal membrane resistance by a factor of ~5,000 and decreases axonal capacitance by ~50. This leads to a faster action potential propagation.
