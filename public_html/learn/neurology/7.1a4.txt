Our movements make a profound influence upon the incoming flow of sensory information. A key factor in determining the incoming visual input is where we are looking. What we sense with our skin touch receptors depends upon our movements. More air streams past the nasal epithelium when we sniff enhancing the total number of odorant molecules. Sniffing may also give rise to specific sampling of a given volume of air at the time of the sniff.
