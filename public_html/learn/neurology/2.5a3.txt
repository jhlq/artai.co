In voltage-clamp recordings, the voltage is clamped at a desired value and the transmembrane currents are measured. For a good voltage-clamp the entire membrane of the cell at all times needs to be at the command voltage designated by the experimenter. If the membrane potential is not changing, then there are no capacitative currents (follows from Q = C.V; if dV/dt is zero, dQ/dt is also zero, i.e. no current).
