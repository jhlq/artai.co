GABA acts by binding to GABA-A receptors, which are ionotropic channels permeable to Cl-. GABA-B receptors, which are metabotropic, act via G-proteins to open K+ conductances. Both chloride and potassium conductances reduce the probability of action potential firing in the postsynaptic neuron and GABA is therefore an inhibitory neurotransmitter. In addition, GABA-B also inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels.
