Dopaminergic neurons in the SNc project most strongly to the striatum. The striatum is a relatively large brain area, which can be divided into the dorsal and the ventral striatum (also called nucleus accumbens). The midbrain dopaminergic neurons can be divided into two groups: those located in ventral tegmental area (VTA) that heavily innervate nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex, and those located in SNc that innervate dorsal striatum.
