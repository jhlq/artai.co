<h1>Week 6: Mindfulness</h1>
<p><h2>Mind wandering</h2></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Qy5A8dVYU3k"> TED talk: Mind wandering causes unhappiness.</a></p>
<p><h3>How to focus a wandering mind</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_focus_a_wandering_mind">http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_focus_a_wandering_mind</a></p>
<p>Mind wandering can be leveraged to improve focus through meditation. </p>
<p>In focused attention meditation one is instructed to keep focus on a single element, such as ones breath or heartbeat. Try.</p>
<p>Practicing in such a way make thoughts less intrusive, the waves don't stop rocking the boat but one learns to navigate them and gradually the boat can be steered to calmer waters.</p>
<p>During periods of mind-wandering, regions of the brain’s default mode network were activated. Then when participants became aware of this mind-wandering, brain regions related to the detection of salient or relevant events came online. After that, areas of the executive brain network took over, re-directing and maintaining attention on the chosen object. All on the time scale of 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Repeated mental exercise is like going to the gym, only you’re building your brain instead of your muscles. And mind-wandering is like the weight you add to the barbell—you need some “resistance” to the capacity you’re trying to build. Without mind-wandering to derail your attempts to remain focused, how could you train the skills of watching your mind and controlling your attention?</p>
<p>Mindfulness meditation has become an increasingly important treatment of mental health difficulties like

, and even

<p>Do not see mind wandering as failure during meditation, rather see them as a beneficial product of your meditation: during focused awareness one ascends to more clear states of consciousness resulting in thoughts and insights from clarity forming during descent.</p>

<p><h2>What is mindfulness?</h2></p>
<p>It is to be fully present in the now.</p>
<p>While mindfulness is innate, it can be cultivated through proven techniques, particularly seated, walking, standing, and moving meditation (it’s also possible lying down but often leads to sleep); short pauses we insert into everyday life; and merging meditation practice with other activities, such as yoga or sports.</p>
<p>When we’re mindful, we reduce stress, enhance performance, gain insight and awareness through observing our own mind. We also increase our attention to the well being of others.</p>
<p>Mindfulness meditation gives us a time in our lives when we can suspend judgment and unleash our natural curiosity about the workings of the mind, approaching our experience with warmth and kindness—to ourselves and others.</p>
<p>Mindfulness and meditation is present in spiritual traditions from all over the world.</p>
<p><h3>Terms of happiness</h3></p>
<p><ul><li>Mindfulness: non-judgmental, moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment.
</li>
<li>
Meditation: refers to a wide range of practices that simply involve training the mind to achieve a particular state of consciousness, especially for relaxation.
</li>
<li>
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR): The MBSR program usually has students meet for two to three hours per week for eight weeks, practicing at home between classes. They learn practices such as the "body scan," in which they focus their attention along each part of the body, trying to be aware and accepting of whatever they sense in these body parts, and the "raisin meditation," where they slowly use all of their senses, one after another, to observe a raisin in great detail, from the way it feels in their hand to the way its taste bursts on the tongue.
</li>
<li>
Attention: the taking possession of the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what may seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thoughts.
</li>
<li>
Awareness: the ability to attain insight into one's own attitudes, motives, reactions, strengths and vulnerabilities. Being in the feelings of the now.

<p><h2>Happiness Practice #5: Mindfulness</h2></p>
<p>Three varieties: Mindful Breathing, Body Scan Meditation, and Loving Kindness Meditation.</p>
<p><h3>Mindful Breathing: Try It Now</h3></p>
<p>To do mindful breathing focus your attention on your breath, then inhale and exhale.</p>
<p>It might help to start by taking an exaggerated breath: a deep inhale through your nostrils (3 seconds), hold your breath (2 seconds), and a long exhale through your mouth (4 seconds). Otherwise, simply observe each breath without trying to adjust it; it may help to focus on the rise and fall of your chest or the sensation through your nostrils. As you do so, you may find that your mind wanders, distracted by thoughts or bodily sensations. That’s OK. Just notice that this is happening and gently bring your attention back to your breath.</p>
<p><a href="http://marc.ucla.edu/mpeg/01_Breathing_Meditation.mp3"> A short guided meditation track.</a></p>
<p><ul><li>Enter a relaxed and comfortable position.
</li>
<li>

<li>
When the mind wanders refocus attention.
</li>
<li>
Notice your breath, in silence. When interrupted return to your breath.
</li>
<li>
Once again notice your body, your whole body, seated here. Let yourself relax even more deeply.
</li>
</ul></p>
<p><h3>Body Scan Meditation</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://marc.ucla.edu/mpeg/Body-Scan-Meditation.mp3">http://marc.ucla.edu/mpeg/Body-Scan-Meditation.mp3</a></p>
<p><ul><li>Begin by bringing your attention into your body.

<p><h3>Loving Kindness Meditation</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://www.emmaseppala.com/gift-loving-kindness-meditation/">http://www.emmaseppala.com/gift-loving-kindness-meditation/</a></p>
<p><ul><li>Receiving Loving-Kindness: Feel love and kindness from people who love you, dead or alive. Bask in the warm wishes and love coming from all sides. You are filled, and overflowing with warmth and love.
</li>
<li>
Sending Loving-Kindness to Loved Ones: In a order you prefer, or in no order at all, send loving awareness to those you love.
</li>
<li>
Sending Loving-Kindness to Neutral People: Now think of an acquaintance, someone you don’t know very well and toward whom you do not have any particular feeling. You and this person are alike in your wish to have a good life. Send all your wishes for well-being to that person.
</li>
<li>
Sending Loving-Kindness to All Living Beings: Now expand your awareness and picture the whole globe in front of you as a little ball. Send warm wishes to all living beings on the globe, who, like you, want to be happy.
</li>
<li>
Take a deep breath in. And breathe out. And another deep breath in and let it go. Notice the state of your mind and how you feel after this meditation.
</li>
</ul></p>
<p><h3>Mindfulness: The Why and The How</h3></p>
<p>Research suggests an effective way to deal with these difficult feelings: the practice of "mindfulness,” the ability to pay careful attention to what you're thinking, feeling, and sensing in the present moment without judging those thoughts and feelings as good or bad. Countless studies link mindfulness to better health, lower anxiety, and greater resilience to stress.</p>
<p>After setting aside time to practice mindful breathing, you should find it easier to focus attention on your breath in your daily life—an important skill to help you deal with stress, anxiety, and negative emotions; cool yourself down when your temper flares; and sharpen your skills of concentration.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that mindfulness increases the more you practice it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460668"> These results suggest that the focused breathing exercise helps to improve participants’ ability to regulate their emotions.</a></p>
<p>Mindful breathing in particular is helpful because it gives people an anchor--their breath--on which they can focus when they find themselves carried away by a stressful thought. Mindful breathing also helps people stay “present” in the moment.</p>
<p><h4>Body scan meditation</h4>
Designed to help you develop a mindful awareness of your bodily sensations, and to relieve tension wherever it is found. Research suggests that this mindfulness practice can help reduce stress, improve well-being, and decrease aches and pains. </p>
<p>Research suggests that people who practice the body scan for longer reap more benefits from this practice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17899351"> Participants who attended eight weekly sessions of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MSBR) program showed increases in mindfulness and well-being.</a></p>
<p>By noticing the pain we’re experiencing, without trying to change it, we experience relief.</p>
<p>Our feelings of resistance and anger toward pain often only serve to increase that pain, and to increase the distress associated with it. The body scan is designed to counteract these negative feelings toward our bodies. This practice may also increase our general attunement to our physical needs and sensations, which can in turn help us take better care of our bodies and make healthier decisions about eating, sleep, and exercise.</p>
<p><h4>Loving kindness meditation</h4>
Practicing kindness is one of the most direct routes to happiness.</p>
<p>Loving Kindness Meditation is a great way to cultivate and express kindness. It involves mentally sending goodwill, kindness, and warmth.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18954193"> People who practiced loving kindness meditation daily for seven weeks, compared to those in a waitlist control group, reported an increase in daily positive emotions.</a></p>
<p>Loving kindness meditation increases happiness in part by making people feel more connected to others—to loved ones, acquaintances, and even strangers. Research suggests that when people practice loving kindness meditation regularly, they start automatically reacting more positively to others, making their social interactions and close relationships more satisfying. Loving kindness meditation can also reduce self-focus, which can in turn lower symptoms of anxiety and depression. </p>

<p><h2>Benefits of Mindfulness</h2></p>
<p>Mindfulness and happiness can be trained.</p>
<p><a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Davidson-Mindfulness_on_Brain_and_Immune_Functionpdf.pdf"> Mindfulness physically changes the brain.</a></p>
<p>Research shows that spending as little as 30 minutes per day training our minds to do something different can result in measurable changes that can be tracked in a brain scanner.</p>
<p>We can intentionally shape the direction of plasticity changes in our brain.</p>
<p>Short periods of practice done many times in a way that can actually be sprinkled throughout the day is a really powerful way to promote enduring change in the brain.</p>
<p><h3>A little meditation goes a long way</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/a_little_meditation_goes_a_long_way">http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/a_little_meditation_goes_a_long_way</a></p>
<p>Meditating for 30 minutes a day for eight weeks can increase the density of gray matter in brain regions associated with memory, stress, and empathy.</p>
<p>For decades, people who’ve completed the MBSR training have reported feeling less stress and more positive emotions; participants suffering from chronic illnesses say they experience less pain afterward.</p>
<p>The MBSR participants, none of whom were experienced meditators, reported spending just under half an hour per day on their meditation “homework.” Yet when their brains were scanned at the end of the program, their gray matter was significantly thicker in several regions than it was before.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/01/25/1015950108.abstract"> The hippocampus of people in their 60s increased in volume after they’d walked around a track three times per week for a year; in peers who did less aerobic exercises, the hippocampus actually got smaller.</a></p>
<p>Small steps matter. Many of us can bring about positive effects on our brains and overall well-being—without an Olympic effort.</p>
<p><h3>Finding right meditations</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/which_kind_of_mindfulness_meditation_is_right_for_you">http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/which_kind_of_mindfulness_meditation_is_right_for_you</a></p>
<p><ul><li>The sitting meditation, which involves sitting in a relaxed but erect posture and cultivating awareness of each breath you take.
</li>
<li>
The body scan, which entails methodically paying attention to each part of your body, from top to bottom.
</li>
<li>
Mindful yoga, the practice of deliberate, intentional movement. 
</li>
</ul></p>
<p><ul><li>Yoga improved well-being more than sitting meditation and body scan, which the authors argue may be linked to “longstanding evidence that physical exercise promotes psychological health” and well-being, rather than specifically mindfulness.
</li>
<li>
Yoga and sitting meditation improved emotion regulation more so than in the body scan group. Why this might be is still a mystery, but the authors note that sitting meditation involves explicit instructions to observe strong emotions without holding on or trying to get rid of them, simply allowing them to be as they are.
</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Body scanning can be useful for discovering and resolving subconscious pain as well as cultivating increased tactile sensitivity.</p>
<p>Whether you've tried all three mindfulness practices or not, please take a moment to do one, two, or three of them now. You'll be glad you did!</p>
<p><h2>Mindfulness applied</h2></p>
<p>Leaders in the fields of education, health care, criminal justice, and beyond have developed mindfulness-based programs for their fields, with encouraging results.</p>
<p><h3>Mindfulness at school</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/mindful_kids_peaceful_schools">http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/mindful_kids_peaceful_schools</a></p>
<p>Seven-year-old Emily sums up her experience of learning meditation: “I like the class because it makes me calm and soft inside. It makes me feel good.”</p>
<p>“There was less conflict on the playground, less test anxiety—just the way the kids walked into the classroom was different. Our state test scores also went up that year, which I’d like to attribute to my teaching but I think had more to do with the breathing they did right before they took the test.”</p>
<p>Many schools are adopting mindfulness trainings because the techniques are easy to learn and can help children become more responsive and less reactive, more focused and less distracted, more calm and less stressed. Mindfulness can produce internal benefits to kids and create a more positive learning environment, where kids are primed to pay attention.</p>
<p>In one classroom, the children went from having the most behavioral problems in the school—as measured by number of visits to the principal’s office—to having zero behavioral problems, after only two to three weeks of instruction.</p>
<p>Susan Smalley has found that a modified version of MBSR can help teenagers with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) by reducing their anxiety and increasing their ability to focus. She is continuing to work with ADHD teens, but her encouraging results have prompted her to wonder if MBSR might help other groups of children—particularly preschoolers, who must learn to regulate their emotions and behaviors to be successful throughout school.</p>
<p>Mindfulness gives kids a tool for understanding how their brain works, for having more self-control.</p>
<p><h3>Working mindfully</h3></p>
<p>Ask yourself: What is the quality of my mind at work? What’s happening in my mind as the hours at work go by day in and day out? Is my mind working at its utmost?</p>
<p>The mind contains untold resources and possibilities—for creativity, kindness, compassion, insight, and wisdom. It’s a storehouse of tremendous energy and drive. </p>
<p>Through mindfulness, we can train our minds to work better.</p>
<p>By training us to pay attention moment by moment to where we are and what we’re doing, mindfulness can help us choose how we will behave, nudging (or jolting) us out of autopilot mode. Here are a few suggestions for how to bring mindfulness into our workplace. This won’t just give us some relief from stress; it can actually change, even transform, how we work.</p>
<p><h4>Check your lenses.</h4>
We should check how we’re seeing before we try to change what we’re seeing. First, we need to make sure our lens is clear. </p>
<p>When we’re convinced things ought to be a certain way and they’re not, we suffer. What we need to explore is whether our distress really derives from the workplace itself or instead from how we apply our default ways of perceiving to the challenges we face at work. </p>
<p>The mind will try to force any situation it meets into its favorite ways of perceiving, through mindfulness we instead let the experience guide our perception. </p>
<p>Whenever you detect yourself falling into an old, familiar pattern, stop and examine what is actually going on. Recognize the negative charge generated by your body, thoughts, and emotions. Accept that it has arisen, then make the decision to be in control of it instead of being controlled by it.</p>
<p><h4>Put some space between you and your reactions.</h4>
Inﬂexible patterns of perceiving inevitably prove too small, too conﬁning, for all that  our minds need to encompass and accomplish. We may end up saying or doing something hurtful, something we’ll regret later and may have to apologize for. We leapt before we looked. Conversely, when we stop to examine how we typically respond to situations, we create space for more creative and ﬂexible responses. Ultimately, as we build the habit of mindfully examining our responses in the moment, mindful awareness becomes our new default mode.</p>
<p>Becoming aware of the impact of a slight has had on you is the ﬁrst step. Separate yourself from yourself just enough to allow you to examine, free from rote reactions, how your body, emotions, and thoughts are combining to gear up for a response.</p>
<p>By decoupling what’s happening from your reaction to what’s happening, odds are you will prevent yourself from simply being carried along by the experience and instead will prove yourself capable of getting ahead of it.</p>
<p>States of being, which can seem so permanent and monumental, are not in fact static. They shift moment to moment, and they can change in response to our awareness of them. It’s amazing how easily a grimace can morph into a smile.</p>
<p>There’s no need to assume that mindful self-examination means you have to allow your coworker to take credit where credit isn’t due. Rather, its goal is to allow you to respond in a new way that frees you from old, ingrained, automatic patterns.</p>
<p><h4>Pay attention to the small stuff.</h4>
Consciously, conﬁdently meeting experiences, instead of being carried away by them, is a practice you can apply in all situations. </p>
<p>Be aware of routine actions such as the way you hoist the phone to your ear when it rings, bringing choice, attention, and awareness back into things that you’ve allowed to become automatic. By opening up to the tiniest habit, you make it possible to crack open the larger habits, which seem more resistant to change. You can look at every action and interaction freshly.</p>
<p>The more you understand your own mind, the more you can understand the minds of others. If you come to understand your own body language, you can read the body language of others  better. Mindfulness doesn’t give you a crystal ball, but it tends to increase your empathy, your ability to put yourself in someone’s shoes with greater understanding. It enhances your connection with other people and supports you as you build relationships. No action, reaction, interaction, or relationship ever feels uninteresting or unworkable if a curious mind is brought to bear on it. </p>
<p><h4>Make a habit of it.</h4>
For mindfulness to work at work, it helps to have both a formal practice of mindfulness and informal practices that extend mindfulness into everyday life. Formal practice involves learning a basic mindfulness meditation such as following the breath and practicing it on a regular, preferably daily, schedule. Informal practice, no less important, can literally take place any second of the day. It involves nothing more than focusing the mind on whatever is happening in the present moment, outside of the shopworn patterns we have built up over a lifetime.</p>
<p>Mindfulness interrupts the conditioned responses that prevent us from exploring new avenues of thought, choking our creative potential. Each time we stand up against a habit—whether it’s checking our smartphone during a conversation or reacting defensively to a coworker’s passing remark— we weaken the grip of our conditioning. We lay down new tracks in the brain  and fashion new synaptic connections.</p>
<p>Mindfulness can transform entire organizations.</p>
