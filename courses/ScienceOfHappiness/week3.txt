***Compassion and kindness
We fundamentally enjoy contributing to others welfare.

Have you tried the active listening exercise from week 2?

**Origins of Compassion
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_compassionate_instinct The compassionate instinct.

Compassion and benevolence are rooted in our brain and biology and ready to be cultivated for the greater good.

*The biological basis of compassion
Seeing our children evoke similar neural responses to seeing victims of violence. 

Helping others triggered activity in the caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate, portions of the brain that turn on when people receive rewards or experience pleasure. 

Being compassionate causes a chemical reaction in the body that motivates us to be even more compassionate.

*Signs of compassion
There is a particular facial expression of compassion, characterized by oblique eyebrows and a concerned gaze. When someone shows this expression, they are then more likely to help others. 

Touching neglected pups can reverse the effects of their previous social isolation, going as far as enhancing their immune systems.

Compassion appears to be something we're universally capable of expressing and understanding, as simply as through a stroke on the arm.

*Motivating altruism
Does compassion promote altruistic behavior? When we take the other’s perspective, we feel an empathic state of concern and are motivated to address that person’s needs and enhance that person’s welfare, even at our own expense.

Compassion motivates anonymous acts of kindness.

Compassion is deeply rooted in nature, overwhelms selfish concerns and motivates altruistic behavior.

*Cultivating compassion
Positive emotions are less determined by DNA than negative ones. Compassion is a trait we can develop.

Good secure parents have more compassionate children.

Parents who reason with their children about the effects of their actions better nurture compassion than those who simply declare what they think is right and wrong.

*A more compassionate world
We see that compassion is deeply rooted in our brains, our bodies, and in the most basic ways we communicate. What’s more, a sense of compassion fosters compassionate behavior and helps shape the lessons we teach our children.

We must make room for our compassionate impulses to flourish.

**Terms of happiness
<ul>
Kindness is a general, everyday term describing behaviors that involve being friendly, generous, or considerate. Pro-social is the term favored by scientists to refer to kind, helpful behaviors or states.
Compassion: Literally means "to suffer together."
Altruism: Altruism is when we act to promote someone else’s welfare, even at a risk or cost to ourselves. 
Empathy: Emotion researchers generally define empathy as the ability to sense other people’s emotions (affective empathy), coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else might be thinking or feeling (cognitive empathy).
Sympathy: Means "to feel together".
Pity: Feeling sorry for the suffering or misfortune of someone else.
</ul>

*Measuring compassion
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/measuring_compassion_in_the_body Is there a biological fingerprint for compassion?

The parasympathetic branch (PNS) promotes behaviours like "rest and digest", "feel and breed" and "tend and befriend", these directly relate to the Vagus nerve, which turns out to be something of an enforcer for the PNS when it comes to the heart and compassion.

The Vagus nerve calms our hearts beating in a rhytmic manner, faster when we inhale, slower when we exhale. The Vagal activity or tone is measured through the differences in these speeds during breathing.

Warm, sensitive parenting for three year olds predicts greater focused concentration, the Vagal tone effect was largely related to the children’s concentration skills.

Feeling compassionate is correlated to increased Vagal tone.

What happens in your Vagus affects whether or not you can handle the feelings provoked by another person’s suffering, and whether or not you’ll feel concerned and motivated to help.

**Kindness-happiness loop
*Kids like being kind
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/being_kind_makes_kids_happy Being kind makes kids happy.

Kids became happy by giving treats and even happier when they had the option of eating the treat themselves but chose to give it away anyways.

Studies suggest that
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/kindness_makes_you_happy_and_happiness_makes_you_kind/ adults are happier giving to others
and
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_motivates_kids_to_help_others kids are motivated to help.

http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/raising_happiness/post/five_ways_to_raise_kind_children/ Rewarding children for kindness may be counterproductive.

Altruism is a reward in itself, even (especially) to very young kids.

http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/dunn%20aknin%20norton.pdf Giving promotes happiness.

*Kindness Makes You Happy and Happiness Makes You Kind
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/kindness_makes_you_happy_and_happiness_makes_you_kind

Two recent studies suggest that giving to others makes us happy, even happier than spending on ourselves. What’s more, our kindness might create a virtuous cycle that promotes lasting happiness and altruism. 

Performing kind and/or novel acts daily boosts happiness.

Recalling a selfless act produces more joy than remembering a selfish one. Being happy from remembering a selfless act makes us more likely to make more acts of kindness.

Charitable organizations can remind and thank donors of previous donations to increase the likelyhood of another donation.

*Kindness and romance
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/is_kindness_physically_attractive Is kindness attractive?

Faces are graded as more beautiful when described with positive words such as honest.

People can continue to be physically repelled by people they perceive to be morally corrupt for decades.

Being driven and hard working increases physical attractiveness rating whereas being lazy decreases it.

We see those we like as more attractive.

"If you want to enhance your physical attractiveness, become a valuable social partner."

By strengthening the content of your character you become more beautiful.

*It feels good to be kind.
There is biological evidence that kindness fosters happiness.

http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/5_ways_giving_is_good_for_you 5 ways giving is good for you:
<ul>
Giving makes us feel happy.
Giving is good for our health.
Giving promotes cooperation and social connection.
Giving evokes gratitude.
Giving is contagious.
</ul>

**Happiness practice 3: Random acts of kindness
Taking the time to do kind acts for others can systematically boost happiness.

This practice involves performing five acts of kindness in one day. 

To get ideas for your acts of kindness, it can help to think about times in your past when you've been the recipient of kindness.

Take a moment to think about your own past acts of kindness.

List acts of kindness that cou can perform on your Acts of Kindness days.

Variety is key: Performing the same acts over and over is not as good as performing new kind acts, cultivate creative inspiration to continously discover novel kindness.

http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/ Sonja Lyubomirky has done research on this practice.

**Getting better at compassion
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_increase_your_compassion_bandwidth

We can beneficially expand our compassion.

People think they will feel more compassion when more people are suffering but they actually feel less. To raise donations it is more effective to present aided/needy individuals than entire populations, people zone out in the face of too much suffering and feel as if their donation will make little difference.

People feel more compassion for one than for many but only when they are compelled to help.

We can choose to not restrict the compassion we feel, choose to be compassionate.

If we can get people past their fears of being overwhelmed, and teach them strategies for staying with rather than avoiding compassion, then we can increase their compassion bandwidth.

Strategies for increasing compassion bandwidth:
<ul>
Increase the sense that helping will make a difference.
Offer easy convenient ways of helping.
Train your brain for compassion over the long term.
</ul>

Compassion cultivation techniques have been shown to  
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156028/ increase positive emotions and social support 
and 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22661409 reduce negative distress at human suffering.

Mindfulness has two important sub-components: the ability to attend to the present moment and the ability to accept experiences without judging them. Both increase inclinations to help.
