***Compassion and kindness
We fundamentally enjoy contributing to others welfare.

Have you tried the active listening exercise from week 2?

**Origins of Compassion
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_compassionate_instinct The compassionate instinct.

Compassion and benevolence are rooted in our brain and biology and ready to be cultivated for the greater good.

*The biological basis of compassion
Seeing our children evoke similar neural responses to seeing victims of violence. 

Helping others triggered activity in the caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate, portions of the brain that turn on when people receive rewards or experience pleasure. 

Being compassionate causes a chemical reaction in the body that motivates us to be even more compassionate.

*Signs of compassion
There is a particular facial expression of compassion, characterized by oblique eyebrows and a concerned gaze. When someone shows this expression, they are then more likely to help others. 

Touching neglected pups can reverse the effects of their previous social isolation, going as far as enhancing their immune systems.

Compassion appears to be something we're universally capable of expressing and understanding, as simply as through a stroke on the arm.

*Motivating altruism
Does compassion promote altruistic behavior? When we take the other’s perspective, we feel an empathic state of concern and are motivated to address that person’s needs and enhance that person’s welfare, even at our own expense.

Compassion motivates anonymous acts of kindness.

Compassion is deeply rooted in nature, overwhelms selfish concerns and motivates altruistic behavior.

*Cultivating compassion
Positive emotions are less determined by DNA than negative ones. Compassion is a trait we can develop.

Good secure parents have more compassionate children.

Parents who reason with their children about the effects of their actions better nurture compassion than those who simply declare what they think is right and wrong.

*A more compassionate world
We see that compassion is deeply rooted in our brains, our bodies, and in the most basic ways we communicate. What’s more, a sense of compassion fosters compassionate behavior and helps shape the lessons we teach our children.

We must make room for our compassionate impulses to flourish.

**Terms of happiness
<ul>
Kindness is a general, everyday term describing behaviors that involve being friendly, generous, or considerate. Pro-social is the term favored by scientists to refer to kind, helpful behaviors or states.
Compassion: Literally means "to suffer together."
Altruism: Altruism is when we act to promote someone else’s welfare, even at a risk or cost to ourselves. 
Empathy: Emotion researchers generally define empathy as the ability to sense other people’s emotions (affective empathy), coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else might be thinking or feeling (cognitive empathy).
Sympathy: Means "to feel together".
Pity: Feeling sorry for the suffering or misfortune of someone else.
</ul>

*Measuring compassion
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/measuring_compassion_in_the_body Is there a biological fingerprint for compassion?

The parasympathetic branch (PNS) promotes behaviours like "rest and digest", "feel and breed" and "tend and befriend", these directly relate to the Vagus nerve, which turns out to be something of an enforcer for the PNS when it comes to the heart and compassion.

The Vagus nerve calms our hearts beating in a rhytmic manner, faster when we inhale, slower when we exhale. The Vagal activity or tone is measured through the differences in these speeds during breathing.

Warm, sensitive parenting for three year olds predicts greater focused concentration, the Vagal tone effect was largely related to the children’s concentration skills.

Feeling compassionate is correlated to increased Vagal tone.

What happens in your Vagus affects whether or not you can handle the feelings provoked by another person’s suffering, and whether or not you’ll feel concerned and motivated to help.
