***Cooperation & reconciliation
**Cooperation & happiness
*Cooperation in nature
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/birds_do_it_bats_do_it

There is a tremendous amount of cooperation in nature.

Cooperation is one of the most important and beneficial behaviors on Earth.

<ul>
Ants: Seem controlled by a single brain. Have evolved traffic systems. Inspire robotics.
Fish: Eat parasites off eachother, even inside mouths. 
Birds: Warn eachother at personal risk. Help those that have helped them.
Bats: Share food. Non sharers eventually get cut off.
Humen: Write wikis. Are already and beoming more cooperative.
</ul>

*The Cooperative Instinct
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_cooperative_instinct

Cooperating stimulates reward circuitries in the brain.

Quick decisions are generally more cooperative.

Remembering good intuitive decisions make us more cooperative.

Cooperation is advantageous.

**Peacemaking
Did you try the Acts of Kindness practice from last week?

*Peace among primates
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/peace_among_primates

Peaceful primates mate for life and males help substantially with child care.

Even usually violent primates can make peace under the right conditions.

The action of genes is completely intertwined with the environment in which they function. 

Primates genetically adapted for one environment can readjust to a new setting in hours.

In one experiment violent primates were mixed with peaceful ones and changed their behaviour to be peaceful aswell, this change persisted even as they were put back into a group of primarily violent primates. Such peaceful behaviour has been shown to spread throughout a group and persist for decades.

A relaxing atmosphere is contagiuos.

Presenting a image of a primate not previously interacted with subliminally can arouse fear.

Even the most violent of species can develop harmonious peace in relatively short periods of time.

*Born to blush
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/born_to_blush

We reflexively become submissive when embarassed, to avoid conflict.

Embarassment is a healthy reaction, a bad alternative people sometimes exhibit is aggression. Good people question their own cababilities and are able to admit fault.

Embarrassment can be a peacemaking force that brings people together.

At the heart of the embarrassment display is humility and modesty.

The gaze aversion, downward head movements, awkward smiles and face touches are a language of cooperation.

Embarrassment is like an ocean wave: It throws you and those near you down to Earth, but you come up embracing and laughing.

*Apologies

*What makes a good apology?
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/making_peace_through_apology Making peace through apology.

Apology is a vital, often necessary, step toward assuaging feelings of humiliation, promoting forgiveness, and restoring balance to a relationship.

Four parts of an effective apology: acknowledgment of the offense; explanation; expressions of remorse, shame, and humility; and reparation.

Acknowledgement is most commonly inadequate, the apologizer must be aware what is being apologized for, and not diminish the other experience of the other party. Phrases like "for whatever I did" or "if mistakes were made" are inappropriate.

Stating you feel sorry for someone is far from taking responsibility for hurtful actions.

Saying "there is no excuse" is better than a shallow excuse.

Explanations need to show similar incidents are unlikely to recur.

Reparation is to offer compensation for suffering.

Healing factors of apologies are: restoration of dignity, affirmation of shared values, victims not feeling responsible, future safety, justice, compensation, dialogue where victims can express their feelings.

Forgiveness comes spontaneously; the victim feels like his offender has released him of a burden or offered him a gift. In response, it can be good to return the gift by downplaying the damage done to himself, sharing part of the blame for the offense, or complimenting the offender in some way. Commonly, the relationship becomes stronger with a bond forged out of the honesty and courage of the offending party.

There are situations in which it is useful to forgive without an apology. One obvious example is where the offending party is deceased. Forgiveness then helps the aggrieved get on with his life. Without an apology, it is difficult to imagine forgiveness accompanied by reconciliation or restoration of a trusting relationship.

**Science of forgiveness
*Forgiveness philosophy
Forgiveness does not mean that we condone what happened in the past. It's not forgive and forget. Forgiveness is about releasing yourself from the prison of hate.

For native Americans grief is valued for it brings people closer to the Gods.

The Dalai Lama sat with nuns who had been imprisoned, they answered to the question if they had been afraid with that what they had been most afraid of was to lose their compassion toward the guards.

http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/forgiveness_instinct The capacity for forgiveness is a built-in feature of human nature. 

We are more forgiving in secure social settings.

*Forgiving boosts happiness
Study after study of forgiveness shows that forgiving others who have caused you harm systematically reduces personal distress and fosters happiness:

http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/mmccullough/Papers/Rumination,%20Emotion,%20and%20Forgiveness_JPSP.pdf
</ul>

Forgiveness doesn't necessarily even mean reconciling with the person who hurt you. Instead, it means changing your own attitude toward this original hurt so that it doesn't continue to wound you.

*Forgiveness works
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_new_science_of_forgiveness

Forgiveness isn't just practiced by saints or martyrs, nor does it benefit only its recipients. Instead, studies are finding connections between forgiveness and physical, mental, and spiritual health and evidence that it plays a key role in the health of families, communities, and nations.

The forgiving person becomes less motivated to retaliate against someone who offended him or her and less motivated to remain estranged from that person. Instead, he or she becomes more motivated by feelings of goodwill, despite the offender's hurtful actions. In a close relationship, we hope, forgiveness will not only move us past negative emotions, but move us toward a net positive feeling. It doesn't mean forgetting or pardoning an offense.

People are usually more willing to forgive if they sense trust and a willingness to sacrifice from their partner.

In one study: People who showed high motivations for revenge and avoidance had lower relationship satisfaction. People who tended to forgive reported greater relationship quality and also greater commitment to relationships.

Forgiveness can be learned and trained.

Sincere apologies helped people forgive and calm down. Getting fair restitution on top of an apology magnified the effect. Insincere or incomplete apologies actually riled people up more.

*Forgiveness and resilience
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/fred_luskin_explains_how_to_forgive Nine steps to forgiveness:
<ul>
Know exactly how you feel about what happened and be able to articulate what about the situation is not OK. 
Make a commitment to yourself to feel better.
Forgiveness does not necessarily mean reconciling with the person who upset you or condoning the action. In forgiveness you seek the peace and understanding that come from blaming people less after they offend you and taking those offenses less personally.
Get the right perspective on what is happening. 
At the moment you feel upset, practice stress management such as mindful breathing.
Give up expecting things from your life or from other people that they do not choose to give you.
Put your energy into looking for another way to get your positive goals met than through the experience that has hurt you.
Remember that a life well lived is your best revenge. 
Amend the way you look at your past so you remind yourself of your heroic choice to forgive.
</ul>

Is the essence of forgiveness being resilient when things don't go your way? That is, being able to handle "no" when you wanted or expected a "yes" in life.

*The choice to forgive
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_choice_to_forgive

http://www.learningtoforgive.com/

Forgiveness isn't just wishful thinking. It's a trainable skill. 

Forgiveness can reduce stress, blood pressure, anger, depression, and hurt, and it can increase optimism, hope, compassion, and physical vitality. 

Forgiving someone does not mean forgetting or approving of hurtful events in the past. Rather, it means letting go of your hurt and anger, and not making someone endlessly responsible for your emotional well-being.

By putting less blame on the past, we can change the way we feel in the present.

Perhaps the most fundamental benefit of forgiveness is that over time it allows us access to the loving emotions that can lie buried beneath grievances and grudges.

**Happiness practice: Forgiving
http://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/eight_essentials_when_forgiving

Make a decision to forgive, and ask yourself, are you ready to deliberately try to reduce resentment towards this person, and instead offer him or her kindness, respect, generosity, even love?

Write down several offsenses and rate them according to how much suffering they have caused you. Begin with the least serious one and follow these guidelines:
<ul>
Ask yourself: How has this person's offense negatively impacted my life?
Make a decision to forgive.
Ask yourself these questions about the person who has hurt you: What was life like for this person while growing up? What wounds did he or she suffer from others that could have made him or her more likely to hurt you?
Be aware of any little movement of your heart through which you begin to feel even slight compassion for the person who offended you. 
Try to consciously bear the pain that he or she caused you so that you do not end up throwing that pain back onto the one who offended you, or even toward unsuspecting others, such as loved ones. Please be aware so that you are not perpetuating a legacy of anger and injuries.
Think of a gift or a kind act that you can offer to the person you are trying to forgive.
Try to find meaning and purpose in what you have experienced. Those who have suffered gain the ability to understand others suffering, let your pain turn you into a more compassionate and benevolent person.
</ul>

**Building trust
*Brain trust
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/brain_trust

Oxytocin facilitates trust and can help those with social phobia.

We have a deeply rooted ability to trust.

*Trust in relationships
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/john_gottman_on_trust_and_betrayal

Trust isn't just important for couples. It's also vital to neighborhoods and states and countries. Trust is central to what makes human communities work.

There's less philanthropy in low-trust regions, greater crime of all kinds, lower longevity, worse health, lower academic achievement in schools.

Couples who cooperatively trust eachother are more healthy.

To build trust in a relationship aim to ATTUNE:
<ul>
Awareness of your partner's emotion;
Turning toward the emotion;
Tolerance of two different viewpoints;
trying to Understand your partner;
Non-defensive responses to your partner;
and responding with Empathy.
</ul>

Once you start thinking that you can find a better partner, then you begin a cascade of not committing to the relationship; of trashing your partner instead of cherishing your partner; of building resentment rather than gratitude; of lowering your investment in the relationship; of not sacrificing for the relationship; and of escalating conflicts.

We can work to make relationships more trusting and people more trustworthy.
