***Week 6: Mindfulness
**Mind wandering
https://youtu.be/Qy5A8dVYU3k TED talk: Mind wandering causes unhappiness.

*How to focus a wandering mind
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_focus_a_wandering_mind

Mind wandering can be leveraged to improve focus through meditation. 

In focused attention meditation one is instructed to keep focus on a single element, such as ones breath or heartbeat. Try.

Practicing in such a way make thoughts less intrusive, the waves don't stop rocking the boat but one learns to navigate them and gradually the boat can be steered to calmer waters.

During periods of mind-wandering, regions of the brain’s default mode network were activated. Then when participants became aware of this mind-wandering, brain regions related to the detection of salient or relevant events came online. After that, areas of the executive brain network took over, re-directing and maintaining attention on the chosen object. All on the time scale of 10 seconds.

Repeated mental exercise is like going to the gym, only you’re building your brain instead of your muscles. And mind-wandering is like the weight you add to the barbell—you need some “resistance” to the capacity you’re trying to build. Without mind-wandering to derail your attempts to remain focused, how could you train the skills of watching your mind and controlling your attention?

Mindfulness meditation has become an increasingly important treatment of mental health difficulties like

Do not see mind wandering as failure during meditation, rather see them as a beneficial product of your meditation: during focused awareness one ascends to more clear states of consciousness resulting in thoughts and insights from clarity forming during descent.

**What is mindfulness?
It is to be fully present in the now.

While mindfulness is innate, it can be cultivated through proven techniques, particularly seated, walking, standing, and moving meditation (it’s also possible lying down but often leads to sleep); short pauses we insert into everyday life; and merging meditation practice with other activities, such as yoga or sports.

When we’re mindful, we reduce stress, enhance performance, gain insight and awareness through observing our own mind. We also increase our attention to the well being of others.

Mindfulness meditation gives us a time in our lives when we can suspend judgment and unleash our natural curiosity about the workings of the mind, approaching our experience with warmth and kindness—to ourselves and others.

Mindfulness and meditation is present in spiritual traditions from all over the world.

*Terms of happiness
<ul>
Mindfulness: non-judgmental, moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment.
Meditation: refers to a wide range of practices that simply involve training the mind to achieve a particular state of consciousness, especially for relaxation.
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR): The MBSR program usually has students meet for two to three hours per week for eight weeks, practicing at home between classes. They learn practices such as the "body scan," in which they focus their attention along each part of the body, trying to be aware and accepting of whatever they sense in these body parts, and the "raisin meditation," where they slowly use all of their senses, one after another, to observe a raisin in great detail, from the way it feels in their hand to the way its taste bursts on the tongue.
Attention: the taking possession of the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what may seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thoughts.
Awareness: the ability to attain insight into one's own attitudes, motives, reactions, strengths and vulnerabilities. Being in the feelings of the now.
</ul>

**Happiness Practice #5: Mindfulness
Three varieties: Mindful Breathing, Body Scan Meditation, and Loving Kindness Meditation.

*Mindful Breathing: Try It Now
To do mindful breathing focus your attention on your breath, then inhale and exhale.

It might help to start by taking an exaggerated breath: a deep inhale through your nostrils (3 seconds), hold your breath (2 seconds), and a long exhale through your mouth (4 seconds). Otherwise, simply observe each breath without trying to adjust it; it may help to focus on the rise and fall of your chest or the sensation through your nostrils. As you do so, you may find that your mind wanders, distracted by thoughts or bodily sensations. That’s OK. Just notice that this is happening and gently bring your attention back to your breath.

http://marc.ucla.edu/mpeg/01_Breathing_Meditation.mp3 A short guided meditation track.

<ul>
Enter a relaxed and comfortable position.
Be aware of and relax your body.
Be aware of your breath.
When the mind wanders refocus attention.
Notice your breath, in silence. When interrupted return to your breath.
Once again notice your body, your whole body, seated here. Let yourself relax even more deeply.
</ul>

*Body Scan Meditation
http://marc.ucla.edu/mpeg/Body-Scan-Meditation.mp3

<ul>
Begin by bringing your attention into your body.
Notice your body.
Take a few deep breaths. As you exhale, have a sense of relaxing more deeply.
Notice the pressure from the ground.
Notice your legs.
Notice your back.
Soften your stomach.
Notice your hands.
Relax your shoulders.
Observe your throat.
Soften facial muscles.
Notice your whole body.
Be aware and breathe.
</ul>

*Loving Kindness Meditation
http://www.emmaseppala.com/gift-loving-kindness-meditation/

<ul>
Receiving Loving-Kindness: Feel love and kindness from people who love you, dead or alive. Bask in the warm wishes and love coming from all sides. You are filled, and overflowing with warmth and love.
Sending Loving-Kindness to Loved Ones: In a order you prefer, or in no order at all, send loving awareness to those you love.
Sending Loving-Kindness to Neutral People: Now think of an acquaintance, someone you don’t know very well and toward whom you do not have any particular feeling. You and this person are alike in your wish to have a good life. Send all your wishes for well-being to that person.
Sending Loving-Kindness to All Living Beings: Now expand your awareness and picture the whole globe in front of you as a little ball. Send warm wishes to all living beings on the globe, who, like you, want to be happy.
Take a deep breath in. And breathe out. And another deep breath in and let it go. Notice the state of your mind and how you feel after this meditation.
</ul>

*Mindfulness: The Why and The How
Research suggests an effective way to deal with these difficult feelings: the practice of "mindfulness,” the ability to pay careful attention to what you're thinking, feeling, and sensing in the present moment without judging those thoughts and feelings as good or bad. Countless studies link mindfulness to better health, lower anxiety, and greater resilience to stress.

After setting aside time to practice mindful breathing, you should find it easier to focus attention on your breath in your daily life—an important skill to help you deal with stress, anxiety, and negative emotions; cool yourself down when your temper flares; and sharpen your skills of concentration.

Evidence suggests that mindfulness increases the more you practice it.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16460668 These results suggest that the focused breathing exercise helps to improve participants’ ability to regulate their emotions.

Mindful breathing in particular is helpful because it gives people an anchor--their breath--on which they can focus when they find themselves carried away by a stressful thought. Mindful breathing also helps people stay “present” in the moment.

<h4>Body scan meditation</h4>
Designed to help you develop a mindful awareness of your bodily sensations, and to relieve tension wherever it is found. Research suggests that this mindfulness practice can help reduce stress, improve well-being, and decrease aches and pains. 

Research suggests that people who practice the body scan for longer reap more benefits from this practice.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17899351 Participants who attended eight weekly sessions of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MSBR) program showed increases in mindfulness and well-being.

By noticing the pain we’re experiencing, without trying to change it, we experience relief.

Our feelings of resistance and anger toward pain often only serve to increase that pain, and to increase the distress associated with it. The body scan is designed to counteract these negative feelings toward our bodies. This practice may also increase our general attunement to our physical needs and sensations, which can in turn help us take better care of our bodies and make healthier decisions about eating, sleep, and exercise.

<h4>Loving kindness meditation</h4>
Practicing kindness is one of the most direct routes to happiness.

Loving Kindness Meditation is a great way to cultivate and express kindness. It involves mentally sending goodwill, kindness, and warmth.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18954193 People who practiced loving kindness meditation daily for seven weeks, compared to those in a waitlist control group, reported an increase in daily positive emotions.

Loving kindness meditation increases happiness in part by making people feel more connected to others—to loved ones, acquaintances, and even strangers. Research suggests that when people practice loving kindness meditation regularly, they start automatically reacting more positively to others, making their social interactions and close relationships more satisfying. Loving kindness meditation can also reduce self-focus, which can in turn lower symptoms of anxiety and depression.

**Benefits of Mindfulness
Mindfulness and happiness can be trained.

http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Davidson-Mindfulness_on_Brain_and_Immune_Functionpdf.pdf Mindfulness physically changes the brain.

Research shows that spending as little as 30 minutes per day training our minds to do something different can result in measurable changes that can be tracked in a brain scanner.

We can intentionally shape the direction of plasticity changes in our brain.

Short periods of practice done many times in a way that can actually be sprinkled throughout the day is a really powerful way to promote enduring change in the brain.

*A little meditation goes a long way
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/a_little_meditation_goes_a_long_way

Meditating for 30 minutes a day for eight weeks can increase the density of gray matter in brain regions associated with memory, stress, and empathy.

For decades, people who’ve completed the MBSR training have reported feeling less stress and more positive emotions; participants suffering from chronic illnesses say they experience less pain afterward.

The MBSR participants, none of whom were experienced meditators, reported spending just under half an hour per day on their meditation “homework.” Yet when their brains were scanned at the end of the program, their gray matter was significantly thicker in several regions than it was before.

http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/01/25/1015950108.abstract The hippocampus of people in their 60s increased in volume after they’d walked around a track three times per week for a year; in peers who did less aerobic exercises, the hippocampus actually got smaller.

Small steps matter. Many of us can bring about positive effects on our brains and overall well-being—without an Olympic effort.

*Finding right meditations
http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/which_kind_of_mindfulness_meditation_is_right_for_you

<ul>
The sitting meditation, which involves sitting in a relaxed but erect posture and cultivating awareness of each breath you take.
The body scan, which entails methodically paying attention to each part of your body, from top to bottom.
Mindful yoga, the practice of deliberate, intentional movement. 
</ul>

<ul>
Yoga improved well-being more than sitting meditation and body scan, which the authors argue may be linked to “longstanding evidence that physical exercise promotes psychological health” and well-being, rather than specifically mindfulness.
Yoga and sitting meditation improved emotion regulation more so than in the body scan group. Why this might be is still a mystery, but the authors note that sitting meditation involves explicit instructions to observe strong emotions without holding on or trying to get rid of them, simply allowing them to be as they are.
Members of the sitting meditation group were significantly less judgmental towards their own feelings and experiences than those who practiced yoga and the body scan, which is likely due to the sitting meditation’s “more explicit instructions against judging one’s experiences.”
</ul>

Body scanning can be useful for discovering and resolving subconscious pain as well as cultivating increased tactile sensitivity.

Whether you've tried all three mindfulness practices or not, please take a moment to do one, two, or three of them now. You'll be glad you did!
