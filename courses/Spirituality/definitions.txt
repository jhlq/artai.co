Coherent sets of definitions are subjectively beautiful, right definitions are a matter of aestehtics. 

"We" is "experiencer".

"Be" is "experience".

"We are" becomes "experiencer experiencing."

We are what we create. Why? This relation unites Islam, where God created all, with pantheistic religions that contain the notion "God is all". 

"Become" is "emerge".

"Creating" becomes "becoming".
