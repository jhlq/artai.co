Coherent sets of definitions are subjectively beautiful, right definitions are a matter of aestehtics. 

"We" is "experiencer".

"Be" is "experience".

"We are" becomes "experiencer experiencing."

We are what we create. Why? This relation unites Islam, where God created all, with pantheistic religions that contain the notion "God is all". 

"Become" is "emerge".

"Creating" becomes "becoming". 

Who is causing? Is to cause something to have done it? If a body puts a vase on a table then the I associated with that body has put the vase on the table. If the body accidentally knocks the vase over then the same I has broken the vase. If a second body disturbs the first body causing it to knock over the vase then the I associated with both bodies has broken the vase. Is to cause something even unintentionally to have done it?

What is the difference between the I associated with a body and the body?

Where does the I end?
