** Questions and answers about meditation and enlightenment
 
 
 
*What am I responsible for in life?
Take responsability for your own state of consiousness. For humanity is not an abstract, it is you. And to change humanity you first take responsibility for changing your state of mind. Am I generating negativity ? You are the beginning of the transformed world. Everybody has not reached that stage that they know that they can take responsibility for their own state of consiousness.They cannot be hold responsible because they are unconsious. But, they will have to suffer the concequences of that unconsiousness, which is suffering. And the long term result of suffering is the burning out of the ego. This is the long way towards a change of state of consiousness. The spiritual pathways offers a shortcut. (Content taken from: Eckhard Tolle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DgPaoObetE)

*How can I help my fellow human being?
You are not only responsible for your state of consiousness, you are also consequently responsible for your actions, that flow from your consiousness. Your actions should be beneficial for the universe, that is, for yourself, for other people, for nature, and everything that is. Your potential to act is like a sack of potatoes.You have several options with what to do with that sack of potatoes. You can put the potatoes in the ground and grow them so that they multiply and can feed many.In this case you are acting with a good purpose, and will benefit others and yourself. Or, you can eat the sack of potatoes all by yourself (or feed your immediate surroundings with it). In this case you are acting selfishly and deprive both yourself and others the benefit of harvesting a multitude of potatoes in season.You are not activly harming anyone, but neither are you benefiting anyone. Or, finally, you can make the sack of potatoes into strong liquor, getting drunk on it and selling it to other people to get drunk and ruin their lives. In this case you are acting destructively and harming the universe, spreading negativity.

*If I have to prioritize, which is the most important to do: protect nature, save people from dying, alleviate pain, help people grow spiritually and intellectually, improve myself?
All of these choices are essentially pain alleviation. Go where your life force guides you, can a flower be advised on whether to grow in a forest or a desert?
If you need to use oars to make your boat move you are going against the stream. When you act from within, from the force of life, you flow forward without effort. Drop the oars and flow to the ocean.

*How do I do to meditate, very practically (special place, posture, time. etc)?
In every place, at every time, with good posture.

*What should I focus on when I meditate?
Love

*What should I do when I have a lot of (bad) thought during meditation?
It is important not to identify with thoughts that come and go when you meditate. The thoughts are generated by the global consciousness and your choose freely which are "your" thoughts. If you get terrible thoughts you can simple state: "these are not my thoughts, It was not I that came up with them". Since we naturally believe that all our thoughts are created by our own ego we tend to get entangled in them, defending them, explaining them, feeling ashamed of them, trying to repress them etc. But once you realize that the thoughts comes from the global consciousness you can just leave them be without worriying about them. Continue instead to fill your mind with compassion and love for the universe and for specific elements in it.
When meditating seek not to silence thoughts, treat the thoughts you encounter as people discussing in a public place. No matter how much a thought feels like "you" you cannot forcefully silence it, since it isn't you. The real you knows not words, it knows only love. Seek to make the thoughts you encounter hear and listen to the wordless love.

*How much should I meditate?
As much as possible. The goal is that every moment of your life is filled with mindful meditation. This is the short answer. You may not arrive there at once though, but may require practice.Therefore it may be a good idea to set aside a specific time for formal practice. This may be as short as ten minutes or twenty minutes, the important thing is that you get into the practice on a regular basis. You can then expand the times as is possible for you, and in time the effects from the formal times of practice will spill over to your entire life, so that your whole life will be a meditation.

*Can you give some examples of what I can to learn to meditate?
  
Try to be conscious of the act of sitting down every time you sit down. This is harder than it seems. Do this for a week and see if you improve your ability of being mindful of yourself and your actions in the presense.If you manage mindfully being aware that you are in the process of sitting down every time when you sit down, you can extend this practice to encompass other simple tasks, as for example passing through a door, brushing your teeth, washing the dishes etc. The end goal is to be consinuously in a mindful state of mind.
 
Dedicate your breath to life growing from your crown chakra, feel the life growing when you breathe and know that as you lose awareness the life succumbs.
Another thing you can to is to draw a Buddha each day -- it could be a simple draft or intricately detailed. Create a mental picture of the mood of the Buddha. Why? Because if one imagines a smile, one becomes happy; one manifests the mood that is attached to one's thoughts. By creating mental formations associated to certain emotions you improve your ability to make these emotions happen. Picture and manifest yourself as enlightened.

*What is the meaning of life?
To feel good, given the insight that we all share the same consciousness. When one suffers all suffer.

*Why am I here on earth?
It might very well be the case that many souls that arrive at this planet do this as a "punishment" ... At the same time many are here to help. We are all of us always every soul, so when you take a step, humanity takes the step with you. Both helping and "punished" souls have caused your bodily manifestation and continue to give rise to its expressions. When a thought or emotion appears in your consiousness, theses are not "yours", they are created by all the planet's consiousness. It can seem depressing when the situation is horrible, as people are full of bad influences (this goes for all of us, so fight against it!), but once you have seen the salvation all fear immidiately dissapears. Enlightenment is a gradual transformation and at the same time immidiate transcendence.

*Is there a God/ what is God?
God is a word with the meaning we assign to it. The word has as many meanings as the number of times its meaning has been pondered. One definition can be "God is everything here is if this everything is conscious", with this definition God exists: the Universe is holographic, each part contains the whole (http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/optmod/holog.html#c4 ) and here we are, conscious.
A related question is "Who am I?" The more you get to know yourself the richer your answer will be. Ask yourself who you are often and experience the evolution of your answer.

*What is the nature of the universe?
Dawn is here, nothing can prevent illuminating rays from obliterating the darkness that pervades these lands. The entire cosmos acts as a wedge in uplifting the shroud that has engulfed this planet for so long.
Splinters in Unity must be treated as open wounds for it is in strife that the bastions of darkness latch on. Treat those whose acts are foul as good people trapped in a maze of mirrors, they act vile because everywhere they look they see their own vile acts. Love them like childhood friends and be a shining light of guidance in their life. Do not reflect hate, be opaque to anger, lest you too get lost in the maze.
Acts of evil are the grasp of darkness, it acts through the blind by leading them astray, it gouges eyes to prevent the sight of who we are.
One of the most important insights is that we all are one, ethics and moral follow naturally from this fact. If one acts with this conviction one heals not only the society one lives in, but also one's human body: cancer is cells that believe they are seperated from the body, schizofrenia is experienced separation of different parts of the brain that therefore do not communicate efficiently with each other, in auto-immune disorders the body experiences parts of itself as alien. Even non-bodily disorders can be cured. If an organism gets into one's body, one can either view it as a threat and start a war or as a resourse and begin negotiating. How one's body reacts  instinctively is connected with how one reacts to hikers setting up camp on one's land.

*Does angels exist?
Yes

*What kind of creatures are angels?
Beings that strive toward the greatest good.

*How can I get in contact with angels (if it is possible)?
Contact your higher self. Each and every soul contains angelic nature. Let your higher self guide your actions. Resonate with good and good will contact you. Angels are already with you.

*How do I know if I have reached enlightenment?
When you know we are all one consciousness. 
In order to become enlightened one should act like an enlightened person. Enlightened persons can choose what emotion they want to experience, so choose an emotion you would like to experience and practice experiencing it.

*How come I in my meditation can affekt others?
We are all the same conciousness.

*Is there life after death?
Yes, as a plethora of research proves: http://www.near-death.com/reincarnation/research/ian-stevenson.html

*I have a relational problem (with a friend, a spouse, a child, a parent, etc), what can I do to heal the relationship again?
Treat the problem as a illness of your body, to heal you need to find the cause, merely treating the symptoms can actually worsen the condition much like taking painkillers while ignoring what is causing the pain.

*I am very concerned about a person who has emotional troubles; what can I do to help?
Meditate on increasing his or hers wellbeing. Don't let negative streams get hold of you in a way that increase their strength.

*Why are there different religions? 
Why are there many languages? Are they really different? Do not all languages convey communication? Religions are frameworks of definitions through which to view the world, their purpose can be seen to be being beautiful, from this the answer to the first question becomes "so there is more beauty".

*Are any religions better than others?
Yes and no. Let us first filter out trivial cases such as religions created by those without religious insight along with religious views that contain erroneous elements, some humen consider religious facts to be outside the realm of verification however that is a transient product of the scientific state of evolution on this planet. Now the remaining religions have sprung forth from deep communion with fundamental reality and diffused like a pure spring through desert sand, even when blended into thick mud the water is still present. Water can mix with many elements, if you are more comfortable in air than in sand, then look toward rain for water.

*What is the difference (if any) between what for instance Christians and Muslims call "God", and what you call the universal "consciousness"?
Nothing. Everything. Depends on if the Christian or Muslim you ask knows about the all-pervading field of consciousness. 

*Many religious traditions use fasting as a spiritual exercise; in what way (if any) would fasting enhance the experience in meditation?
It is through the experience of hunger that hunger is transcended.

*Is it a good idea to be active within a religion? (If not, why not?)
Yes and no. It is a good way to meet likeminded. It is also a way to occlude the likemindedness of those not of that religion.

*What happens when I die?
This question has as many answers as to what happens when we are born. Then as now you are surrounded by entities who have access to your record, all of our actions are saved for public scrutiny and while no one has absolute power to direct where you go those around you are well able to influence the course of your voyage.

One may find a beloved waiting to take their hand, others may find people they betrayed latching on to drag them down. Those who live for material wealth find loneliness, to lay resources on personal gain is to spell out your own doom in the form of lost companionship; The joys of traversing the eons with deeply connected shipmates knows no bounds.

*How do I find likeminded people?
Depends on your mind. You have already attracted a whole lot of likemindedness that is so intertwined with your being that it is you, for eternities you have plowed through the cosmos as a vibration harnessing that which with you resonates. Look within your mind and heart, there you will find the company you seek.

*How can I go about making the right choices in Life?
Choose that which is best for the whole. Choices that carry personal benefit are good only in such ways that the benefit carries onto others, if you like sailing then carry people across lakes. Choose from the view that your own material wealth has negative value, for it is in complete surrender to the service of all that the keys to heaven are hidden. Become nothing and you will feel everything.
