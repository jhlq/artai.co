Fats contain more energy per gram than carbohydrates and proteins. Excess energy from all three sources can be stored in the body as fat.
Foods with low glycemic index release their energy gradually, avoiding spikes in blood sugar and insulin. Refined sugars have high glycemic index and are broken down quickly, leaving a lot of insulin in the blood that was summoned to take care of it. Natural carbohydrates instead usually decline in tandem with insulin resulting in a more harmonious digestion.
Vegetables contain fibers and unsaturated fats.
Several vegetable protein sources can be combined to provide a more complete protein intake, such as beans and maize or rice and lentils. 
Omega 3 unsaturated fats cannot be made by the human body. 
Unsaturated fats are usually liquid, these are the most healthiest. Saturated fats pack more densely making them solid, they increase LDL cholesterol which can be bad. Trans fats should be avoided, these decrease HDL and can be found in industrially fried food.
