***General Relativity
This tutorial is based on 
http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Carroll3/Carroll_contents.html lecture notes by Sean Carroll:

"These notes represent approximately one semester's worth of lectures on introductory general relativity for beginning graduate students in physics. Topics include manifolds, Riemannian geometry, Einstein's equations, and three applications: gravitational radiation, black holes, and cosmology."
