***Basics
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language

Begin documents with &lt;!doctype html&gt;

Include javascript files like so: &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

**Structural elements
http://web.archive.org/web/20140306141627/http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/new-structural-elements-in-html5/ These elements are based on data mining that determined the most frequent ids and classes often used with the div element.

*&lt;header&gt;
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-header-element

Introduction of "sectioning elements": an article, a section, the entire document (header page). Typically the header of a Web site that appears on top of each page, or a header of a long article or section.

*&lt;footer&gt;
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-footer-element

Contains the footer of a site, a long article or section.

*&lt;nav&gt;
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-nav-element

Section that contains the main navigation links.

*&lt;article&gt;
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-article-element

Independent content, which can be individually extracted from the document and syndicated (RSS or equivalent) without penalizing its understanding. Typically a blog post.

*&lt;section&gt;
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-section-element

Generic section used to group different articles for different purposes or subjects, or to define the different sections of a single article. Generally used with a header.

*&lt;time&gt;
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element

Used for marking up times and dates.

*&lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt;
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element

Used to encapsulate a figure as a single item, and contains a caption for the figure, respectively.

*&lt;aside&gt;
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-aside-element

Section whose content is not necessarily directly related to the main content that surrounds it, but can provide additional information.

*&lt;main&gt; 
http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-main-element

The main element represents the main content of the body of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central functionality of an application. <b>There can be only one main element in a document </b> and it cannot descend.

*&lt;div&gt; 
For other styling, such as CSS hooks, see the following flowchart for advice on when to use div:

*&lt;hn&gt; 
Headers, replace n with a number, use h1 only once.

A section for each month and an article for each post.

*More on article and section
There can be articles in sections and sections in articles.

Articles can contain the nav and footer elements.

*Headings and structure
Headers h1 to h6 define the document outline which can be visualized with the following extensions:
<ul>
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html5-outliner/afoibpobokebhgfnknfndkgemglggomo Chrome.
https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/html5-outliner/1.0/?display=en Opera.
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/html5_outliner/ Firefox.
http://jsbin.com/binuxo/1/edit Self contained code.
</ul>

Using a h3 after a h2 initiates a subsection in the first h2 whereas using another h2 creates a new section.

*Best practices
Always add a heading to explicit sectioning content. Without a header screen readers will say "Entering section" instead of, when there is a header, "Entering section with heading ..."

The &lt;header&gt; element is just a container. It is not taken into account for defining new sections of a document nor does it affect the hierarchy levels. 

Place the headers inside section and article elements.

Inspect the document outline through one of the extensions presented above.

In order to NOT display the heading content on screen the recommended technique 
http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/08/notes-on-accessible-css-image-sprites/ is described in this article by Steve Faulkner. 
Do not use display:none or visibility:hidden in your CSS stylesheet, as in that case the heading content will never be vocalized by screen readers

All interactive content must have a visible focus indicator (and be on screen when focused).

**Other elements and attributes
*&lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; elements
These elements have been introduced for displaying a foldable zone.

http://jsbin.com/ayojup/2/edit Nesting is possible.

http://www.alsacreations.com/article/lire/1335-html5-details-summary.html Can be styled with CSS. 
Like this:
http://jsbin.com/ifofib/46/edit
Or that:
http://jsbin.com/ifofib/8/edit

Currently NOT supported in all browsers. See:

*Retro-compatibility
A polyfill is a piece of JavaScript code you include in your HTML page, that will emulate HTML5 features not yet implemented in browsers.

Can be found at 
http://caniuse.com/
and 
http://html5please.com/

http://jsbin.com/tupuxo/7/edit Light polyfill for details.

http://jsbin.com/qociye/3/edit This light polyfill does not work 100%.

http://jsbin.com/nogate/1/edit Heavy polyfills can quickly grow to daunting sizes.

*The &lt;time&gt; element.
Provides both a human readable part (the part between <time> and </time>) and a machine readable part contained within a datetime attribute. Dates are expressed as YYYY-MM-DD.

http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2012/best-of-time/

The datetime attribute can be used for indicating a date/time or a duration:
<ul>
<time datetime="1905"> 	The year 1905
<time datetime="1905-11"> 	November 1905
<time datetime="11-13">  	November 13th (any year)
<time datetime="1905-W21"> 	Week 21 from year 1905
<time datetime="1905-11-13 09:00"> 	November 13th year 1905, time = 9:00
<time datetime="1905-11-13T09:00"> 	Same as previous example, both syntaxes are supported, with and without the "T" between date and time.
<time datetime="09:00Z"> 	9:00 in the morning, GMT
<time datetime="09:00-05"> 	9:00 in the morning, GMT minus 5 hours
<time datetime="09:00+05:45"> 	9:00 in the morning, GMT plus 5 hours 45 minutes, (like in Nepal that has 5:45 of difference with GMT)
</ul>

Duration values use the prefix “P” for “period” as in datetime="P4D" (period = four days). So you start the attribute string value with a "P", followed by a duration value that ends with another letter indicating the unit used, like "D" for "days",  “H” for hours, “M” for minutes and “S” for seconds. 

*The &lt;mark&gt; element
Highlight important parts of a text, like "quoting parts", etc.

Display search results with search strings highlighted in the results.

http://jsbin.com/otekov/3/edit

Example CSS: mark {     background-color: green;     color: yellow; }

*The download attribute for links
Change the default name of downloaded objects: &lt;a href="link" download="newname"&gt;

http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#downloading-resources

http://www.htmlfivecan.com/#42

For security reasons the image should be located on the same domain as the HTML page that contains the link.

*The translate attribute
Stop automatic translation of certain words or passages (such as code): &lt;span translate="no"&gt;var love=Infinity&lt;/span&gt;
