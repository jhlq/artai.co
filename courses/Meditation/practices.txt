***Meditation practices.
**Listen to your heart, literally.
The more time you spend feeling the movements of the heart the more of your neurons will be wired to receive this rhytmic beat, the heart becomes a metronome synchronizing the whole of the brain. 

**Inhibit unconscious movement
Feel 3+ conscious breaths and/or 9+ heart beats whenever you perform a movement such as scratching your nose or shifting your legs without first consciously approving the movement.

**Neutralize pain
Meditate on the most gruesome feeling you can imagine, let it rest in your mind until there is no longer any impulse to repel it. Now you no longer have to run by seeking distractions whenever feelings like this arise since you have been immunized to the fear it causes.

It is okay to feel good while meditating on suffering, in so doing the suffering is sprinkled with seeds of life. By maintaining composure through pain you become a backbone supporting the next generation from falling into despair. Even scratching ones nose can be a harmful action of escaping distraction, bodily discomfort often arises from pain in the mind and a scratch inflicts potentially damaging bodily sensations that the mind can focus on to avoid reflecting on its internal state. Dare to feel the pain and it will be rendered neutral.

Neutrality is as joyful compared to the worst suffering as the highest pleasure is compared to neutrality. Choose what you compare to, by meditating on suffering you adopt a point of view that transforms boredom to bliss.
