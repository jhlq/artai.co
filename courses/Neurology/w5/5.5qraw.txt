Question 1 (1/1 point)

Which statement about neocortical GABAergic neurons is incorrect?
Neocortical GABAergic neurons prominently inhibit sub-cortical nuclei Neocortical GABAergic neurons prominently inhibit sub-cortical nuclei - correct
Some subtypes of neocortical GABAergic neurons inhibit other neocortical GABAergic neurons
Neocortical GABAergic neurons represent about 10-20% of the total number of cortical neurons
Most neocortical GABAergic neurons are local interneurons and don't have long-range axonal projections

Explanation

Neocortical GABAergic neurons largely regulate the activity of the local microcircuits in which they are embedded. They usually don't have long-range axonal projections, therefore it is impossible for them to inhibit sub-cortical regions directly.

Question 2 (1/1 point)

Which one below is not a neocortical GABAergic neuron?
Parvalbumin-expressing (PV)
Somatostatin-expressing (Sst)
Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP)
Purkinje cells Purkinje cells - correct

Explanation

The Purkinje cells are located in the cerebellar cortex and they are GABAergic projection neurons. They are not located in the neocortex.

Question 3 (1/1 point)

Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) basket cells innervate which part of postsynaptic target neurons?
Distal dendrites
Soma and proximal dendrites Soma and proximal dendrites - correct
Gap junctions
Axon initial segment

Explanation

The PV-expressing fast-spiking basket cells target soma and proximal dendrites. Fast-spiking axo-axonic cells (also known as chandelier cells) can also express parvalbumin, and inhibit the axon initial segment of the postsynaptic cell, but these cells are not 'basket cells'.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

Where do neocortical somatostatin-expressing GABAergic neurons (Sst) prominently innervate excitatory pyramidal neurons?
Distal dendrites Distal dendrites - correct
Basal dendrites
Nodes of Ranvier
Soma

Explanation

Somatostatin-expressing (Sst) GABAergic neurons of the cortex strongly innervate distal dendrites of excitatory pyramidal neurons. These neurons are also termed 'Martinotti' cells.

Question 5 (1/1 point)

Which neocortical GABAergic neuron sub-type is thought to signal mainly by volume transmisson?
Somatostatin-expressing GABAergic neurons (Sst)
Parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons (PV)
Neurogliaform GABAergic neurons Neurogliaform GABAergic neurons - correct
Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing GABAergic neurons (VIP)

Explanation

Neurogliaform cells release GABA into the extracellular space, thereby mediating volume transmission activating GABA-B receptors to drive slow IPSPs.
