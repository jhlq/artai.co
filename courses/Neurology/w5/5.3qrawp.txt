Question 1 (1/1 point)

Which of the following compounds is not a GABA receptor blocker?
picrotoxin
bicuculline
gabazine
CNQX CNQX - correct
</ul>
Explanatio

GABA receptor antagonists are drugs which inhibit the action of GABA. Examples of GABA-A receptor antagonists include bicuculline, picrotoxin and gabazine. CNQX is an AMPA receptor antagonist.

Question 2 (1/1 point)

Which of the following statements about the action of benzodiazepines is correct?
Benzodiazepines act upon all GABA-A receptors
Benzodiazepines act upon all GABA-B receptors
Benzodiazepines act upon specific subtypes of GABA-A receptors Benzodiazepines act upon specific subtypes of GABA-A receptors - correct
Benzodiazepines act upon specific subtypes of GABA-B receptors
</ul>
Explanatio

Benzodiazepines act upon specific subtypes of GABA-A receptors.

Question 3 (1/1 point)

Which of the following statements about the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines is not correct?
Benzodiazepines do not activate GABA-A receptors by themselves, but they only potentiate GABA-evoked currents
Benzodiazepines increase the affinity of GABA to GABA-A receptor
Benzodiazepines are GABA-A receptor antagonists Benzodiazepines are GABA-A receptor antagonists - correct
Benzodiazepines act on GABA-A receptors containing the a1, a2, a3 or a5 subunits, but not the a4 and a6 subunits
</ul>
Explanatio

Benzodiazepines do not directly activate GABA-A receptors on their own, but only potentiate GABA-evoked currents. In particular, they increase the affinity of GABA-A receptors for binding GABA. Benzodiazepines potentiate GABA-A receptors containing the a1, a2, a3 or a5 subunits, but have no effect on a4 and a6 subunits.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

How do benzodiazepines affect mouse behaviour?
Benzodiazepines induce a sedative effect (sleep) and an anxiolytic effect (anti-anxiety) by acting on the same types of GABA-A receptors
Benzodiazepines induce an anxiolytic effect, which is largely mediated by GABA-B receptors
Benzodiazepines induce a sedative effect (sleep), which is largely mediated by GABA-A-a1 receptors Benzodiazepines induce a sedative effect (sleep), which is largely mediated by GABA-A-a1 receptors - correct
Benzodiazepines induce an anxiogenic effect (increased anxiety), which is mediated by GABA-A-a2 receptors
</ul>
Explanatio

In mice, benzodiazepines induce a sedative effect (sleep), which is mediated by the GABA-A-a1 receptor. Also, they can induce an anxiolytic effect (anti-anxiety), which is mediated by the GABA-A-a2 receptor.

Question 5 (1/1 point)

Why might someone be prescribed benzodiazepenes by their doctor?
To reduce anxiety
To promote sleep or sedation
As an anticonvulsant to prevent epileptic seizures
All of the above are valid All of the above are valid - correct
</ul>
Explanatio

Benzodiazepines induce a sedative effect (sleep), and an anxiolytic effect (anti-anxiety). Because they enhance inhibition, they are also useful in preventing epileptic seizures, which are caused by uncontrolled overexcitation of neuronal networks.
