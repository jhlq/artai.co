Question 2 (1 point possible)

Which of the following statements about the time course of inhibitory conductances mediated by GABA-A receptors is correct?
GABA-A inhibition is fast, and short lasting compared AMPA-mediated excitation GABA-A inhibition is fast, and short lasting compared AMPA-mediated excitation - correct
GABA-A inhibition is fast, but itâ€™s much slower than AMPA-mediated excitation
GABA-A inhibition has almost the same duration as AMPA-mediated excitation
GABAergic inhibition is a slow process, but it's much faster than AMPA-mediated excitation
</ul>
Explanatio

GABAergic inhibition is a fast process, but it's much slower than AMPA-mediated excitation. The GABA-A conductance is five to ten times slower than the AMPA conductance of the glutamatergic synapses. The GABA-A conductance lasts about 10-20 ms, while AMPA conductance may last only 2 ms.

Question 3 (1 point possible)

Which of the following statements regarding IPSPs and/or IPSCs is not correct?
The time course of the synaptic current is the same as the time course of the synaptic conductance The time course of the synaptic current is the same as the time course of the synaptic conductance - correct
IPSPs have longer durations that IPSCs
If the membrane potential is at the chloride reversal potential, then there is no GABA-A-mediated synaptic conductance
An IPSC typically lasts ~10 ms
</ul>
Explanatio

If the membrane potential is at the chloride reversal potential, then there is no GABA-A-mediated synaptic current, but the conductance is still there.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

Which of the following statements regarding hyperpolarising inhibition is correct?
GABA-A synaptic input causes hyperpolarising inhibition when the membrane potential is depolarised relative to the Cl- reversal potential GABA-A synaptic input causes hyperpolarising inhibition when the membrane potential is depolarised relative to the Cl- reversal potential - correct
GABA-A synaptic input causes hyperpolarising inhibition when the membrane potential is hyperpolarized relative to the Cl- reversal potential
GABA-A synaptic input causes hyperpolarising inhibition when the membrane potential is at the Cl- reversal potential
GABA-B synaptic input causes hyperpolarising inhibition when the membrane potential is hyperpolarised relative to the K+ reversal potential
</ul>
Explanatio

GABA-A synaptic input causes hyperpolarizing inhibition when the membrane potential is depolarized relative to the Cl- reversal potential.

Question 5 (1 point possible)

Which of the following statements regarding shunting inhibition is correct?
GABA-A synaptic input causes shunting inhibition due to increased input resistance of the soma GABA-A synaptic input causes shunting inhibition due to increased input resistance of the soma - correct
GABA-A synaptic input causes shunting inhibition due to increased membrane time constant
GABA-A synaptic input causes shunting inhibition due to increased axial resistance
GABA-A synaptic input causes shunting inhibition due to decreased membrane resistance
</ul>
Explanatio

Even if the membrane potential is actually close to the reversal potential of Cl-, GABA-A mediated inhibition can still make a significant impact on the integration of excitatory synaptic inputs. GABA-A Cl- conductance will increase membrane conductance and thus decrease the membrane resistance. Excitatory synaptic input arriving across the dendritic arborisations will thus be subjected to more leaky dendrites and a more leaky soma, thus causing smaller changes in membrane potential.
