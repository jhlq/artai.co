The membrane potential is caused by the electrostatic field generated by differential charge density distribution across the plasma membrane, which has complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Across any given area of membrane, the local value of the membrane potential is given by the local charge density divided by the capacitance (following the standard equation for an electrical capacitor Q = CV).
