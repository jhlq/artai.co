Question 1 (1/1 point)

Why is glutamate considered the most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain?
Most synapses use glutamate as the neurotransmitter
Ionotropic glutamate receptors have a reversal potential of ~0 mV
Activation of glutamate receptors in most neurons causes depolarisation and increases action potential firing
All of the above All of the above - correct
</ul>
Explanatio

Approximately 80% of the synapses in the mammalian brain use the neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate-gated cation channels (ionotropic glutamate receptors) increase their open probability in response to glutamate. Under physiological conditions, they typically have a reversal potential close to 0 mV, which depolarises most neurons (which typically have resting membrane potentials ~-70 mV). The 0 mV reversal potential is also more depolarised than action potential threshold (which is typically ~-45 mV) and activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors therefore increases action potential firing probability. That firing rate increases, defines glutamate as an excitatory neurotransmitter.

Question 2 (1/1 point)

Which statement about AMPA and/or NMDA receptors is incorrect?
Both AMPA and NMDA receptors are permeable to sodium and potassium ions
NMDA receptors need glycine / D-serine to get activated
Both AMPA and NMDA receptors have a reversal potential of ~0 mV
AMPA and NMDA receptors have the same single channel conductance of ~5 pS AMPA and NMDA receptors have the same single channel conductance of ~5 pS - correct
</ul>
Explanatio

Both AMPA and NMDA receptors are permeable to sodium and potassium ions. NMDA receptors are also calcium permeable. AMPA receptors are typically not calcium permeable (except if they lack GluA2 receptors). NMDA receptors need glycine / D-serine as a co-agonist to glutamate in order to get activated. AMPA and NMDA receptors are both cation channels with a reversal potential of ~0 mV. The single channel conductance of AMPA receptors is ~5 pS, whereas the NMDA receptor has ~10 times bigger single channel conductance of ~50 pS.

Question 3 (1/1 point)

Which statement correctly describes the time-course of AMPA and NMDA receptor activation after a pulse of glutamate?
AMPA receptors are much slower than NMDA receptors
NMDA receptors are one-or-two orders of magnitude slower than AMPA receptors NMDA receptors are one-or-two orders of magnitude slower than AMPA receptors - correct
There is no time-course difference between the two receptors.
AMPA receptors act faster in the presence of D-Serine
</ul>
Explanatio

Following a millisecond pulse of glutamate, AMPA receptors increase open probability within ~1 ms, but it takes some time before the NMDA current maximizes (~20 ms). This is long after the glutamate has already gone, and NMDA receptor currents can remain active for hundreds of miliseconds after a glutamate pulse. Thus, the temporal kinetics of AMPA conductance and NMDA conductance are extremely different. NMDA receptors have one or two orders of magnitude slower activity, compared to the extremely fast AMPA receptors.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

NMDA receptors are voltage-dependent under physiological conditions. Why?
S4 voltage-sensing domain, like that of voltage-gated sodium channels
Intracellular polyamines block the ion channel pore
Calcium ions increase open probability
Magnesium ions cause a voltage-dependent block Magnesium ions cause a voltage-dependent block - correct
</ul>
Explanatio

The conductance of NMDA receptors activated by glutamate is strongly reduced at hyperpolarized potentials (more negative than ~-50 mV) under physiological conditions. The reason of this voltage-dependence is different than the voltage-gated sodium/potassium/calcium channels. The NMDA receptors aren't intrinsically voltage-sensitive, but they gain that attribute because of a magnesium block. Magnesium ions enter the NMDA receptor channel pore at negative potentials, interacting with pore-lining amino acid residues and blocking the NMDA receptors. The magnesium ions induce a fast flickering block, as they stochastically enter and leave the ion channel pore. When the cell depolarizes, the magnesium is repelled from the internal binding site by the electric field and the NMDA receptor can fully conduct.

Question 5 (1/1 point)

Glutamate receptors are encoded by many different genes. Which statement about mammalian glutamate receptor diversity is not true?
There are three important gene families of ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA, Kainate, NMDA)
Some mammalian ionotropic glutamate receptors are chloride channels Some mammalian ionotropic glutamate receptors are chloride channels - correct
NMDA receptors composed of NR1 and NR2A subunits are fast compared to other types of NMDA receptors
AMPA receptors lacking the GluA2 subunit are calcium permeable and inwardly rectifying
</ul>
Explanatio

All mammalian ionotropic glutamate receptors are cation channels. However, research into the nematode C. elegans has revealed the existence of ivermectin-sensitive glutamate-gated chloride channels.
