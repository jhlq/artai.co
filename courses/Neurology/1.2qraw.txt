QUESTION 1  (1/1 point)
In a phospholipid bilayer the lipids have

 their hydrophobic heads facing inward  their hydrophilic tails facing outward  their hydrophilic heads facing inward  their hydrophobic tails facing inward their hydrophobic tails facing inward - correct
EXPLANATION

The cell membrane is composed of phospholipids, which are organized into two layers (a bilayer), with the fatty acid chains in each layer pointing towards the center of the membrane. The nonpolar regions of the molecules (hydrophobic) face the interior of the bilayer, where they are shielded from water. On the other hand, the polar regions of the molecules (hydrophilic) face outward where they interact with the water inside and outside of the cell.

QUESTION 2  (1/1 point)
The phospholipid bilayer

 is highly permeable to water molecules  is impermeable to ions and charged molecules is impermeable to ions and charged molecules - correct  is impermeable to gases and small uncharged molecules  is permeable to ions and charged molecules
EXPLANATION

The phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane is highly impermeable to ions and charged molecules. The membrane is highly permeable to small non-polar uncharged molecules, like gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide,nitrogen). The permeability of the membrane to polar (water soluble) molecules is very low. The transport of most molecules and ions across the plasma membrane is enabled by specific membrane proteins, which are embedded into the cell membrane.

QUESTION 4  (1/1 point)
The phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane can be represented as which electrical component?

 Resistor  Inductor  Conductor  Capacitor Capacitor - correct
EXPLANATION

The cell membrane is impermeable to ions, but is so thin that charges can interact through the electric field. The cell membrane is therefore a dielectric and acts as a capacitor.

What would be the approximate surface area of spherical cell with a 10 µm radius?

 10 µm^2  100 µm^2  1000 µm^2 1000 µm^2 - correct  1 mm^2
EXPLANATION

The surface area of a sphere is 4πr^2 = 4 x 3 x 100 = ~1000 µm^2

QUESTION 6  (1/1 point)
What would be the approximate capacitance of such a cell?

 10 fF  10 pF 10 pF - correct  10 nF  10 µF
EXPLANATION

The lipid cell membrane has a specific capacitance of ~1 µF/cm^2. For convenience we can convert this constant into units per µm^2. The specific capacitance of the cell membrane is ~10 fF/µm^2. For a cell with a surface area of 1000 µm^2, this gives 10 fF/µm^2 x 1000 µm^2 = 10 pF.

QUESTION 7  (1/1 point)
Approximately how many positively charged ions would need to move from the outside to the inside of this cell in order to change the membrane potential by +70 mV?

 4 hundred  6 thousand  4 million 4 million - correct  8 billion
EXPLANATION

C = 10 pF

e = 1.6 x 10^-19 C

In order to calculate the number of the ions, first we need to know how much charge would need to change the membrane potential by 70 mv:

Q = C x V

= 10 x 10^-12 F x 70 x 10^-3 V

= 0.7 pC -> the charge

For the number of ions:

Q = Number of ions x e

Q = 0.7 pC

e = 1.6 x 10^-19 C

Q/e -> gives the number of ions

Q/e = 0.7 x 10^-12 C / 1.6 x 10^-19 C

Q/e = ~4 million ions
