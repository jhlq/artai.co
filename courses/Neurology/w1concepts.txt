2. The cell membrane
Lipid: Fatty acids and oils, insoluble in water.
Hydrophobic: Avoids water.
Hydrophilic: Attracts water.
Capacitor: A structure with a gap over which a potential develops.
Capacitance: Ability to store electric charge.

3. Ion channels
Proteins: Building blocks of life.
Helix: Spiral.
Pore: Tunnel.
Gradient: Rate of change.

4. Membrane potential
Flux: Flow through a surface.
Diffusion: The spread of one medium in another.
Hyperpolarization: The cell potential decreases.
Depolarization: The cell potential increases.
Nernst equilibrium equation: E_ion = RT/(zF) log([ion]_out/[ion]_in) where E_ion is the reversal potential, R is the Avogadro gas constant, T the temperature in Kelvin, z the ions charge, F the Faraday constant, log the base 10 logarithm, [ion] is the ion concentration outside and inside the cell.

5. Cable properties
Dendrites: Branches of a neuron that receives impulses.
Attenuation: Gradual decrease.
Soma: The cell cody.
Axons: Branches of a neuron that sends impulses.
Arborisation: Branching.
