 Question 1 (1/1 point)

Which statement about presynaptic neuromodulation in the mammalian brain is not true:
Presynaptic neuromodulation typically results from activation of metabotropic receptors in the presynaptic membrane
Presynaptic neuromodulation causes changes in neurotransmitter release
Presynaptic neuromodulation can be caused by acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA (amongst many others)
Presynaptic neuromodulation typically results from activation of ionotropic receptors in the presynaptic membrane Presynaptic neuromodulation typically results from activation of ionotropic receptors in the presynaptic membrane - correct

Explanation

In the mammalian brain, presynaptic neuromodulation typically results from the activation of metabotropic receptors for many different types of neurotransmitters (including acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA). Ionotropic receptors are not usually involved (although there is evidence that presynaptic NMDA receptors can play a regulatory role, and in the spinal cord there are direct GABAergic synapses on presynaptic terminals).

Question 2 (1/1 point)

A metabotropic receptor typically:
is a membrane protein with seven transmembrane regions signalling via a GTP-binding protein is a membrane protein with seven transmembrane regions signalling via a GTP-binding protein - correct
is a membrane protein with six transmembrane regions forming an ion channel pore
is an intracellar protein signalling via kinase activity
is a membrane protein with a single transmembrane region signalling via the extracellular matrix

Explanation

Metabotropic receptors are membrane proteins with seven transmembrane alpha helices. They are coupled to GTP-binding proteins and when the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, the GTP-binding protein is activated and diffuses away from the receptor to evoke downstream signalling in the cell.

Question 3 (1/1 point)

Metabotropic receptors are characterized by:
faster activation and shorter duration of activity than ionotropic receptors
faster activation but longer duration of activity than ionotropic receptors
slower activation but shorter duration of activity than ionotropic receptors
slower activation and longer duration of activity than ionotropic receptors slower activation and longer duration of activity than ionotropic receptors - correct

Explanation

Because of the mutliple signalling steps involved, metabotropic receptors are characterized by slower activation and longer duration of activation than ionotropic receptors.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

Which of the following statements about presynaptic inhibition in the mammalian brain is false?
Presynaptic inhibition can be mediated by GABA acting on metabotropic GABA receptors on the presynaptic membrane
Presynaptic inhibition is typically mediated by inhibition of Ca2+ channels or vesicle release machinery
Presynaptic inhibition is typically mediated by axo-axonic GABAergic synapses directly innervating axonal boutons Presynaptic inhibition is typically mediated by axo-axonic GABAergic synapses directly innervating axonal boutons - correct
Presynaptic inhibition reduces the release probability of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic bouton

Explanation

Presynaptic inhibition can be mediated by many different types of metabotropic receptors (including GABA receptors), which often inhibit calcium channels or the exocytotic release machinery. This causes a decrease in neurotransmitter release probability. In the mammalian brain, presynaptic inhibition is not mediated by axo-axonic synapses, which are only thought to exist in the spinal cord.

Question 5 (1 point possible)

What happens to short-term synaptic plasticity during presynaptic inhibition by a neuromodulator?
Presynaptic inhibition typically reduces depression and thus increases facilitation
Presynaptic inhibition typically increases depression and thus decreases facilitation
Presynaptic inhibition converts short-term depression into long-term depression
Presynaptic inhibition typically increases depression and thus increases facilitation Presynaptic inhibition typically increases depression and thus increases facilitation - incorrect

Explanation

Presynaptic inhibition causes a decrease in the probability of releasing synaptic vesicles. The first effect is therefore to reduce the efficacy of synaptic transmission evoked by single action potentials. However, during repetitive action potential firing, there is an interesting interaction with the mechanisms of short-term plasticity. Because the first action potential releases less neurotransmitter during presynaptic inhibition, there are more release-ready vesicles remaining than normally when the second action potential in a train arrives. Thus there will be less synaptic depression and facilitation can occur.
