Question 1 
Ion channels are made of what?

 Lipids
Nucleic acids
Carbon nanotubes
Proteins 


Question 2 
What structural feature of an ion channel spans the lipid membrane?

 Alpha helix 
Beta sheet
Coiled coil domains
N-terminal domain


Question 3 
The ion channel pore is largely composed of what?

 Air
Water 
Lipids
Metal


Question 4 
Which statement about transporters (as opposed to ion channels) is not true?

 Transporters move ions at slower rates than ion channels
Transporters passively transport ions along the electro-chemical gradient 
Transporters can work against the electro-chemical gradient
Transporters do not have an aqueous pore


Question 5 
Which of the following statements is not true

 Ion channels are characterized by gating and selectivity
Ion channels can flip from open (conducting) to closed (non-conducting) states on the microsecond timescale
Changing the open probability of ion channels is an important way to regulate transmembrane current flow
Single ion channels can have unitary conductances of 10 nS 


Question 6 
Which of the following statements is not true?

 Selectivity is a preference of ion channels to conduct a specific ion
The degree of selectivity can vary between different ion channels
The degree of ion selectivity is the same for all ion channels 
There are many types of non-selective channels
