***Week 1
**Important concepts
*1. Voltage-gated channels
<ul>
Voltage-gated channel: A ion tunnel that is more likely to be open at certain membrane potentials.
</ul>

*2. Voltage-gating kinetics
<ul>
Kinetics: From Greek "kinesis", movement or to move.
Unit us: Microseconds, actually written Âµs, one millionth of a second.
</ul>

*3. The action potential
<ul>
Action potential threshold: A membrane potential at which a current spike event is initiated.
Neocortical: Substance in the neocortex, the outer part of the brain.
GABAergic: Responds to a signaling GABA molecule with inhibitory activity.
</ul>

*4 Action potential propagation
<ul>
Axial: Along a segment.
Myelination: Wrapping axonal segments with electrically insulating material.
</ul>

*5 Whole-cell recordings
<ul>
Pipette: Thin tube that can suck up fluids.
Patch-clamp: Trap a piece of cell membrane for electrical measuring.
Giga-seal: Electrical resistance seal enabling accurate measurements.
</ul>
