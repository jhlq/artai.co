<ul>
The release rate has a linear relationship with calcium concentration
The release rate goes as the fourth power of the calcium concentration

<ul>

*Question 3.2.4 
How does calcium drive neurotransmitter release?
<ul>
Calcium swells up boutons and synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane
Calcium interacts with charged phospholipid head-groups altering membrane properties allowing vesicle fusion
Caclium binds to syntaxin which leads to phosphorylation of synaptotagmin causing vesicle release
Binds to synaptotagmin, interacting with the SNARE complex, to cause vesicle fusion 
</ul>

*Question 3.2.5

<ul>
Stay in the same spot and refill with neurotransmitter to be able release again
Undergo fast active transport to the cell soma to be refilled with neurotransmitter

Undergo clathrin mediated endocytosis and fusion with golgi apparatus
</ul>

*Question 3.3.2 
Which of the following statements about short-term synaptic plasticity is not correct:
<ul>
Short-term synaptic plasticity mechanisms predominantly occur in the presynaptic bouton
Short-term synaptic plasticity mechanisms always increase the strength of synaptic connections 
Presynaptic efficacy depends on the recent history of synaptic activity
Short-term synaptic plasticity typically changes the neurotransmitter release probability
</ul>

*Question 3.3.3 
What mechanism is thought to underlie short-term syanptic facilitation?
<ul>
Facilitation results from the accumulation of Ca2+ within the presynaptic terminal 
Facilitation results from the accumulation of Ca2+ within the postsynaptic terminal
Facilitation results from the increased efflux of Ca2+ from the presynaptic terminal
Facilitation results from the accumulation of synaptic vesicles within the presynaptic terminal
</ul>

*Question 3.3.4 
What mechanism contributes importantly to short-term synaptic depression?
<ul>
Broadening of the action potential waveform during repetitive firing
Short-term depression results from the depletion of vesicles in the presynaptic terminal 
Calcium-dependent inactivation of synaptotagmin
Short-term depression results from the depletion of Ca2+ in the presynaptic terminal
</ul>

Which of the following statements about post-tetanic potentiation is not correct:
<ul>
Post-tetanic potentiation lasts about 1 minute
Post-tetanic potentiation can be evoked at some synapses by a 100 Hz train of action potentials
Post-tetanic potentiation results from calcium activation of protein kinase C
Post-tetanic potentiation depends upon correlated presynaptic and postsynaptic activity 
</ul>

*Question 3.4.2 
A metabotropic receptor typically:
<ul>
is a membrane protein with seven transmembrane regions signalling via a GTP-binding protein 
is a membrane protein with six transmembrane regions forming an ion channel pore
is an intracellar protein signalling via kinase activity
is a membrane protein with a single transmembrane region signalling via the extracellular matrix
</ul>

*Question 3.4.3 
Metabotropic receptors are characterized by:
<ul>
faster activation and shorter duration of activity than ionotropic receptors
faster activation but longer duration of activity than ionotropic receptors
slower activation but shorter duration of activity than ionotropic receptors
slower activation and longer duration of activity than ionotropic receptors 
</ul>

*Question 3.4.4 
Which of the following statements about presynaptic inhibition in the mammalian brain is false?
<ul>
Presynaptic inhibition can be mediated by GABA acting on metabotropic GABA receptors on the presynaptic membrane
Presynaptic inhibition is typically mediated by inhibition of Ca2+ channels or vesicle release machinery
Presynaptic inhibition is typically mediated by axo-axonic GABAergic synapses directly innervating axonal boutons 
Presynaptic inhibition reduces the release probability of synaptic vesicles from the presynaptic bouton
</ul>

*Question 3.4.5 
What happens to short-term synaptic plasticity during presynaptic inhibition by a neuromodulator?
<ul>
Presynaptic inhibition typically reduces depression and thus increases facilitation
Presynaptic inhibition typically increases depression and thus decreases facilitation
Presynaptic inhibition converts short-term depression into long-term depression
Presynaptic inhibition typically increases depression and thus increases facilitation
