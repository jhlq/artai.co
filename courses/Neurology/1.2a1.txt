The cell membrane is composed of phospholipids, which are organized into two layers (a bilayer), with the fatty acid chains in each layer pointing towards the center of the membrane. The nonpolar regions of the molecules (hydrophobic) face the interior of the bilayer, where they are shielded from water. On the other hand, the polar regions of the molecules (hydrophilic) face outward where they interact with the water inside and outside of the cell.
