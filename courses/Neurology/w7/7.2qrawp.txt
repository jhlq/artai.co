Question 1 (1/1 point)

Which of the following statement about sensory percepts is not correct?
Sensory percepts are learned through experiences
Sensory percepts are subjective
Sensory percepts are actively acquired
Sensory percepts are independent of the observer Sensory percepts are independent of the observer - correct
</ul>
Explanatio

Sensory percepts result from interactions between incoming sensory information and learned stimulus associations from previous experiences. Sensory percepts are learned through experience. The reason we recognize objects is because we've seen many closely related images before and from many different angles. Sensory perception is an active process in at least two different ways. Firstly, motor control is very important for sensory perception, as we actively gather sensory information by making voluntary movements. For example, we make eye and head movements to see specific parts of the visual field, or we move our hands and fingers to touch objects so as to actively get tactile sensory information. Secondly, sensory perception is an active process in another way, in which our neuronal activity can actively generate our sensory percepts. As such, sensory percepts are subjective, and this can easily be understood by looking at images that evoke alternating percepts. One can therefore not claim that percepts are independent of the observer, since they are actually generated by the internal activity of the brain.

Question 2 (1/1 point)

Psychometric curves plot the relationship between stimulus strength and behavioral performance. What is meant by the term "psychometric threshold"?
The stimulus strength at which performance is half-maximal The stimulus strength at which performance is half-maximal - correct
The stimulus strength at which performance is just above chance
The behavioral performance when stimulus strength is half maximal
The behavioral performance when stimulus strength is just above noise level
</ul>
Explanatio

The psychophysical threshold is typically defined as the stimulus strength that yields half-maximal performance (half-way up the performance curve comparing no stimulus to supramaximal stimulation).

Question 3 (1/1 point)

What are the minimal requirements for experimental investigation of subjective sensory percepts?
Human subjects are needed for subjective sensory percepts
Complex stimuli are needed for subjective sensory percepts
Behavioral report of subjective percept by motor output Behavioral report of subjective percept by motor output - correct
Visual stimuli are needed for subjective sensory percepts
</ul>
Explanatio

In order to be able to investigate sensory perception, we need to have a motor output from the subject that reports the internal subjective percept.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

Which experiment tests for the sufficiency of neuronal activity in the C2 barrel column of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) to drive licking in a mouse trained in a detection task in which a 1 ms impulse is applied to the C2 whisker, and the mouse is trained to lick a water reward spout?
Injection of TTX into the C2 barrel column
Injection of CNQX and APV into the C2 barrel column
Optogenetic stimulation of neurons in the C2 barrel column Optogenetic stimulation of neurons in the C2 barrel column - correct
All the above
</ul>
Explanatio

Inactivation of the C2 barrel column with TTX or CNQX/APV tests for the necessity of neuronal activity, but not sufficiency. Optogenetic stimulation experiments test sufficiency. Specifically and directly driving the activity of the neurons in the C2 barrel column to evoke licking demonstrates that the action potential firing in these neurons is sufficient to drive motor output. However, this is presumably evoked by communicating with downstream neurons, and thus S1 is a node in a complex sensorimotor loop.

Question 5 (1/1 point)

What pattern of neuronal activity is found in the C2 barrel column of mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) during a detection task in which a 1 ms impulse is applied to the C2 whisker, and the mouse is trained to lick a water reward spout?
An early sensory response that reliably encodes sensory stimulus
A late depolarization that encodes the subjective sensory percept
Both of the above Both of the above - correct
None of the above
</ul>
Explanatio

In the whisker detection task of Sachidhanandam et al. (2013), an early sensory response in S1 reliably encodes the sensory stimulus, and a late component codes subjective percept as reported by licking motor output.
