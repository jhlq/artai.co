Question 1 
Ion flux through an ion channel is a passive process driven by electrochemical diffusion. Which statement is true?

 There is no current flow if the ion concentrations are equal on both sides of the membrane.
There is no current flow if the electrical potential is equal on both sides of the membrane.
The electrical potential is more important than the concentration gradient.
For any given concentration of ions there is an electrical potential that prevents net current flow. 


Question 2 
What happens to a neuron which has a resting membrane potential of -70 mV, if potassium channels increase their open probability?

 Hyperpolarization 
Depolarization
Repolarization
Nothing


Question 3 
The equilibrium potential

 of a given ion across a membrane is the potential at which there is no net movement of that ion across the membrane due to electrochemical forces
of K+ across a typical nerve cell membrane is close to the resting potential of most neurons
of a given ion across a membrane is a function of the concentration of that ion on both sides of the membrane
all of the above are correct

Question 5 
What are the approximate intracellular and extracellular concentrations of chloride for most mammalian neurons?

 Intracellular 120 mM and Extracellular 5 mM
Intracellular 5 mM and Extracellular 120 mM 
Intracellular 25 mM and Extracellular 100 mM
Intracellular 100 mM and Extracellular 25 mM
