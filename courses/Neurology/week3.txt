*1. Synaptic transmission
<ul>
Vesicle: Container inside cells.
Exocytosis: Expulsion of intracellular molecules contained in a vesicle.
Quantal: Not continuous, ice is quantal, water is not.
Synaptic: Relating to synapses, the sites where messages are conveyed between cells.
Junction: A place where two things meet.
</ul>

*2. Neurotransmitter release
<ul>
Cytosolic: Water-soluble components of cell cytoplasm
Bouton: Neuronal component that connects to other neurons.
Protein complex: Proteins arranged in a structure.
</ul>

*3. Presynaptic dynamics
<ul>
Facilitation: Amplification.
Post-tetanic: After repetitive pulses.
</ul>

*4. Presynaptic modulation
<ul>
Metabotropic: Receptor that acts through a secondary messenger.
Ionotropic: Opens or closes channels.
Plasticity: Ability to change.
</ul>
