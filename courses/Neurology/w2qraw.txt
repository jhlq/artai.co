 Question 1 (1/1 point)

Which aspect of ion channel function depends upon the membrane potential for a voltage-gated channel ?
Single channel conductance
Reversal potential
Open probability Open probability - correct
Ion selectivity

Explanation

The open probability is the fraction of time that an ion channel is in the open state. The open probability of many ion channels is highly regulated and this is also how membrane potential exerts its influence upon voltage-gated channels.

Question 2 (1/1 point)

Which region is the voltage sensing domain of a voltage-gated sodium channel ?
Extracellular N-terminal domain
Channel pore through voltage-dependent Magnesium binding
Auxilary voltage-sensing subunits
S4 transmembrane region S4 transmembrane region - correct

Explanation

Each subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel has six transmembrane regions (S1-S6). S4 is the voltage sensing region. It is the transmembrane alpha helix that can readily move in the ion channel. It is full of arginine amino acids that have a positive charge on them. The ability of the S4 region to be mobile and it's positive charge, allows it to interact with the electric field across the plasma membrane. The movement of the S4 region under the influence of the electric field couples to the open probability for a voltage-gated sodium channel.

Question 3 (1/1 point)

At which potential do the voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels become activated ?
-40 mV and more depolarized -40 mV and more depolarized - correct
-50 mV and more hyperpolarized
-70 mV and more hyperpolarized
between -100 mV and -80 mV

Explanation

Voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels begin to open when the membrane potential is in range from -50 mV to -40 mV. They are closed at resting membrane potentials. As the membrane potential depolarises further (becomes more positive than -40 mV) then the open probability increases steeply.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

Approximately how many sodium channels are needed in order to make a large impact upon the membrane potential of a typical mammalian neuron ?
1
10
100
1000 1000 - correct

Explanation

The single channel conductance of sodium channels is ~20 pS. The input resistance of a typical neuron at rest is around 50 Mohm and thus the total membrane conductance of a typical neuron is ~20 nS. In order to make a major impact on the membrane potential, the total conductance of sodium channels should be around 20 nS. To establish that, approximately 1000 channels need to open.

Question 5 (1 point possible)

Opening voltage-gated potassium channels
Always causes depolarisation under physiological conditions
Always causes hyperpolarisation under physiological conditions
Always drives the membrane potential to the potassium reversal potential Always drives the membrane potential to the potassium reversal potential
The effect depends upon the membrane potential before opening



 Question 1 (1 point possible)

Which statement about the kinetics of voltage-gated sodium channels is incorrect?
Depolarisation can open sodium channels within 100 us. Depolarisation can open sodium channels within 100 us. - incorrect
Depolarisation opens sodium channels only after 100 us.
Depolarisation opens a sodium conductance lasting approximately 200 us.
After activation by depolarisation, voltage-gated sodium channels inactivate on the timescale of hundreds of microseconds.

Explanation

Voltage-gated sodium channels are rapidly activated by depolarisation on the tens of microsecond timescale. The sodium channels inactivate on the hundreds of microsecond timescale and therefore the voltage-gated sodium conductance evoked by depolarisation is transient only lasting ~200 us.

Question 2 (1/1 point)

Which statement about the kinetics of voltage-gated potassium channels is correct?
The potassium conductance is faster than the voltage-gated sodium conductance.
The potassium conductance is delayed and long lasting. The potassium conductance is delayed and long lasting. - correct
The potassium conductance is fully activated within 100 us of depolarisation.
The potassium conductance is fully inactivated within a few hundred microseconds of the activation

Explanation

The voltage-gated potassium conductance is delayed and long lasting, without inactivation. The voltage-dependent activation of the potassium channels is therefore very different from the kinetics of the sodium channels.

Question 3 (1/1 point)

Depolarisation of neurons induces a time-dependent activation of voltage-gated sodium and potassium conductances. What statement below is correct ?
The single-channel conductance of a voltage-gated ion channel depends strongly upon the time-course of the membrane potential.
The open probability of voltage-gated channels depends only upon voltage.
Voltage-gated channels open and close under precise temporal control of the membrane potential
Voltage-gated channels open and close stochastically on the microsecond timescale with a slower underlying change in open probability governed by the membrane potential. Voltage-gated channels open and close stochastically on the microsecond timescale with a slower underlying change in open probability governed by the membrane potential. - correct

Explanation

Ion channels typically open and close stochastically on the microsecond timescale. The open probability of the voltage-gated ion channels is a complex function depending upon both membrane potential and the recent history of activity. The change in open probability of ion channels is typically regulated on a slower time scale than each individual opening and closing event of the ion channels.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

Following the activation of a voltage-gated sodium channel, approximately how long does it take before the channel recovers fully from inactivation?
3 us
100 us
3 ms 3 ms - correct
100 ms

Explanation

The recovery from inactivation of a voltage-gated sodium channel is on the milisecond time scale. After ~3-5 ms, the sodium channel is fully recovered and it can again be fully activated by a voltage-change.

Question 5 (1/1 point)

The voltage-gated potassium channels are
the same ion channel proteins that maintain hyperpolarised resting membrane potentials.
a diverse family of ion channels encoded by many different genes. a diverse family of ion channels encoded by many different genes. - correct
encoded by a single gene in mammals
not structurally related to voltage-gated sodium channels

Explanation

Potassium channels are encoded by a highly diverse family of genes (~80). Voltage-gated potassium channels show homology to voltage-gated sodium and calcium channel families. The voltage-gated potassium channels are encoded by different genes than the potassium channels that are open at rest, which form an important component of the leak conductances, that set the resting membrane potential.
You have used 1 of 1 submissions 
Explanation

Opening voltage-gated potassium channels will always hyperpolarise a typical neuron under normal physiological conditions. The opening of potassium channels will drive the membrane potential towards the potassium reversal potential (but not necessarily reaching it - this depends upon what other conductances are open). The potassium reversal potential is the most negative of all the physiological ions and therefore increasing this conductance always causes hyperpolarisation.

 Question 1 (1/1 point)

Which of the following statements about neuronal action potentials is not true?
Action potentials are all-or-none events lasting ~ 1 ms
Action potentials are all-or-none events lasting ~ 10 ms Action potentials are all-or-none events lasting ~ 10 ms - correct
The amplitude of an action potential depends upon the type and density of sodium and potassium channels
The duration of an action potential depends upon the type and density of sodium and potassium channels

Explanation

The action potential is typically considered an all-or-none event lasting ~1 ms. The precise membrane potential dynamics largely result from the type and density of sodium and potassium channels in the neuronal membrane, as well as the recent history of activity.

Question 2 (1/1 point)

The depolarisation phase of the action potential occurs because of:
the opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels the opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels - correct
the opening of voltage-gated K+ channels
the closure of resting K+ channels
the opening of voltage-gated Clâˆ’ channels

Explanation

The rapid increase in open probability of voltage-gated sodium channels in response to membrane potential depolarisation more positive than -50 mV causes an explosive positive feedback loop driving the upstroke of the action potential. The open probability of the sodium channels peaks within ~100 us, causing an important sodium conductance driving the membrane potential close to the reversal potential for sodium (+60 mV).

Question 3 (1/1 point)

The repolarisation phase of the action potential occurs because:
K+ ions continue to diffuse out of the cell while voltage-gated Na+ ion channels begin to open
of delayed activation of K+ channels after voltage-gated Na+ ion channels begin to close of delayed activation of K+ channels after voltage-gated Na+ ion channels begin to close - correct
Na+ channels remain open after voltage-gated K+ ion channels begin to close
Cl- ions continue to diffuse in the cell after voltage-gated K+ ion channels begin to close

Explanation

The repolarisation of the membrane potential on the downstroke of the action potential is generated by the delayed activation of voltage-gated potassium channels. In the mammalian nervous system, the potassium channels open as the sodium channels close, with a minimal temporal overlap of these conductances.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

Action potential threshold is:
far from the membrane potential at which voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels are activated
reached when the voltage-dependent increase in sodium current outpaces the increase in potassium current over a sufficiently long period reached when the voltage-dependent increase in sodium current outpaces the increase in potassium current over a sufficiently long period - correct
identical for all mammalian neurons
independent of the gating kinetics of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels

Explanation

Action potential threshold is the membrane potential above which an action potential is initiated. The depolarising upstroke of the action potential depends upon the rapid recruitment of voltage-gated sodium channels. They must rapidly drive the membrane potential to positive values, otherwise they will inactivate and thus fail to initiate the action potential. The sodium channels also need to be rapidly activated because the upstroke of the action potential must be completed before the delayed potassium conductance begins to act. The initiation of an action potential at the action potential threshold is therefore determined by the need for the voltage-dependent increase in sodium current to outpace the increase in potassium current over a sufficiently long period to drive the upstroke of the action potential.

Question 5 (1/1 point)

Neocortical fast-spiking GABAergic neurons can fire at much higher rates than neocortical excitatory pyramidal neurons. Why?
They express different potassium channels They express different potassium channels - correct
They have different resting membrane potentials
They have a higher input resistance
They are smaller in size

Explanation

The fast-spiking GABAergic neurons in the neocortex express different types of potassium channels, which cause a faster repolarization of the membrane potential after firing an action potential. This allows the voltage-gated sodium channels to deinactivate more rapidly, decreasing the refractory period and thus allowing the cell to fire the next action potential sooner.

 Question 1 (1/1 point)

Why do most neurons in the mammalian brain need such a signal as the action potential?
To allow flexible and dynamic information coding
To reduce energy expenditure
To encode a high rate of information
To reliably transmit information across long distances To reliably transmit information across long distances - correct

Explanation

The all-or-none action potential is the main way in which information is transmitted across the entire extent of a neuron including dendrites and axons. In most respects the amount of information could be equally well (or better) encoded through graded subthreshold potentials. However, in terms of transmitting this information over long distances, the all-or-none action potential is advantageous because it can be amplified and propagated in a loss-free manner (in the same way that digital communication technologies are now used extensively in modern society).

Question 2 (1/1 point)

Where does the action potential usually initiate in a mammalian neuron?
Soma
Dendrite
Node of Ranvier
Axon initial segment Axon initial segment - correct

Explanation

Action potentials are thought to be initiated at the axon initial segment under most conditions. The axon initial segment has a very high density of voltage-gated sodium channels. This means that this is the point in the neuron that has the lowest voltage activation threshold for the action potential.

Question 3 (1/1 point)

Action potential propagation speed decreases with:
Lower membrane capacitance
Lower axial resistance
Lower resting membrane resistance Lower resting membrane resistance - correct
Larger axonal cross sectional area

Explanation

The action potential speed decreases with lower membrane resistance. If the membrane resistance is low, more current will leak through the membrane and this will decrease the rate of charging the membrane along the cable. The activation of the voltage-gated sodium channels further away from the initiation site will therefore be slower, and, as a result, the speed of action potential propagation will be decreased.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

Myelination strongly affects action potential propagation. Which statement about myelination is incorrect?
Specialised glial cells extend processes wrapping lipid membranes around axons.
Myelination is interrupted at nodes of Ranvier, where the action potential is actively boosted by a high density of voltage-gated sodium channels.
Myelination increases membrane capacitance Myelination increases membrane capacitance - correct
Myelination increases membrane resistance

Explanation

Specialised glial cells (oligodendrocytes in the central and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system) wrap very thin processes around selected axons. Since the myelin processes contain 80% lipid, it is a good electrical insulator. It increases axonal membrane resistance by a factor of ~5,000 and decreases axonal capacitance by ~50. This leads to a faster action potential propagation.

Question 5 (1/1 point)

If an action potential has a duration of 1 ms and an axonal propagation speed of 1 m/s, then what is the spatial extent of the depolarisation along an axonal cable at any given moment in time during action potential firing ?
10 um
100 um
1 mm 1 mm - correct
10 mm

Explanation

The action potential in this example is said to have a duration of 1 ms, when measured at a single point on the neuronal arborisation. The action potential propagation speed is said to be 1 m/s in the example axon. The action potential moves along the axon generating a sequence of depolarisation and repolarisation. The total extent of the depolarisation is roughly given by the duration of the depolarisation (1 ms = 0.001 s) times the speed of the action potential (1 m/s). This gives a length of 1 mm being depolarised across the overall length of the axonal cable at any given moment in time. The location of this 1 mm segment that is depolarised changes as the action potential moves along the axon.

 Question 1 (1/1 point)

What is the main reason to put positive pressure in a patch-clamp recording pipette while approaching the target cell?
Pushing the intracellular solution outside the pipette to keep the cells healthy
To make the glass pipette opening bigger
Keep the pipette tip clean Keep the pipette tip clean - correct
To have a cleaner extracellular space in order to get a better image of the target neuron

Explanation

Putting positive pressure in the pipette while entering the brain slice is a crucial step. Having positive pressure in the pipette keeps the tip clean and that helps to have a good giga-seal and break-in to the cell. If there are some particles on the tip, it is almost impossible to establish a good giga-seal.

Question 2 (1/1 point)

What is a giga-seal?
A giga-ohm scale resistance between the inside of the pipette and the extracellular space when the pipette is attached to the cell membrane A giga-ohm scale resistance between the inside of the pipette and the extracellular space when the pipette is attached to the cell membrane - correct
A tight junction between two neurons with a small leak conductance
A giga-ohm scale resistance at the pipette tip opening
The 'giga' refers to the high rate of ions flowing through channels as observed with the patch-clamp technique

Explanation

When the pipette contacts the neuron we remove the pressure and suck gently to attach to the cell. The observed current flow drops dramatically during the process, which means the resistance between the pipette and the extracellular space increases. It is good to have this resistance in the order of Giga ohms to be able to have good recordings. When the seal resistance is in the order of Giga ohms, it is called a giga-seal.

Question 3 (1/1 point)

Which statement is not true for a cell recorded under good voltage-clamp?
The membrane potential is fixed by the experimenter and current is measured.
The current is fixed by the experimenter and membrane potential is measured. The current is fixed by the experimenter and membrane potential is measured. - correct
The membrane potential is isopotential across the cell membrane.
Capacitative currents play no role in the measured currents.

Explanation

In voltage-clamp recordings, the voltage is clamped at a desired value and the transmembrane currents are measured. For a good voltage-clamp the entire membrane of the cell at all times needs to be at the command voltage designated by the experimenter. If the membrane potential is not changing, then there are no capacitative currents (follows from Q = C.V; if dV/dt is zero, dQ/dt is also zero, i.e. no current).
