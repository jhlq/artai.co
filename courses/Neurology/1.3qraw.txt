QUESTION 1  (1/1 point)
Ion channels are made of what?

 Lipids  Nucleic acids  Carbon nanotubes  Proteins Proteins - correct
EXPLANATION

Ion channels are encoded by genes in the DNA. These genes are transribed into mRNA and subsequently translated into a linear chain of amino acids, which fold in a complex three dimensional structure. Amino acids are the building blocks of all proteins.

QUESTION 2  (1/1 point)
What structural feature of an ion channel spans the lipid membrane?

 Alpha helix Alpha helix - correct  Beta sheet  Coiled coil domains  N-terminal domain
EXPLANATION

In the transmembrane alpha helix of ion channels, the polar groups of the amino acid backbone are all internal, hidden within the helix stabilised by hydrogen bonds. If the amino acid sidechains are hydrophobic, then the entire alpha helix is non-polar, allowing close interaction with the lipid membrane.

QUESTION 3  (1/1 point)
The ion channel pore is largely composed of what?

 Air  Water Water - correct  Lipids  Metal
EXPLANATION

The ion channel pore is where ions can cross from one side of the membrane to the other. The ion channel pore is largely aqueous allowing ions to diffuse freely into the ion channel. Ions in solution are surrounded by water molecules, that is they are hydrated. That ions do not need to dehydrate in order to permeate the ion channel allows fast transport of ions.

QUESTION 4  (1/1 point)
Which statement about transporters (as opposed to ion channels) is not true?

 Transporters move ions at slower rates than ion channels  Transporters passively transport ions along the electro-chemical gradient Transporters passively transport ions along the electro-chemical gradient - correct  Transporters can work against the electro-chemical gradient  Transporters do not have an aqueous pore
EXPLANATION

Transporters can use energy (ATP, or coupled transport of ions with different equilibrium potentials) in order to move ions against their electro-chemical gradient.

QUESTION 5  (1/1 point)
Which of the following statements is not true

 Ion channels are characterized by gating and selectivity  Ion channels can flip from open (conducting) to closed (non-conducting) states on the microsecond timescale  Changing the open probability of ion channels is an important way to regulate transmembrane current flow  Single ion channels can have unitary conductances of 10 nS Single ion channels can have unitary conductances of 10 nS - correct
EXPLANATION

Single ion channels typically have a conductance ~10 pS. That means a single ion channel in its open state can conduct an ionic current of 1 pA if there is an electrical driving force of 100 mV. Single channel conductance varies widely across different types of ion channels, ranging ~0.1-100 pS.

QUESTION 6  (1/1 point)
Which of the following statements is not true?

 Selectivity is a preference of ion channels to conduct a specific ion  The degree of selectivity can vary between different ion channels  The degree of ion selectivity is the same for all ion channels The degree of ion selectivity is the same for all ion channels - correct  There are many types of non-selective channels
EXPLANATION

Selectivity is a preference of the channel to conduct a specific ion. There are different classes of selective ion channels, e.g. sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca+) and chloride (Cl-). The degree of selectivity can vary between different members of the same class and there are also many types of non-selective channels. Ion channels are, almost invariably, at least selective for either positive ions (cations) or negative ions (anions).
