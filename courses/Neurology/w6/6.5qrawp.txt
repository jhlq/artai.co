Question 1 (1/1 point)

With what tool one can do cell-type specific, temporally-controlled brain stimulation?
Microstimulation
Optogenetics Optogenetics - correct
Deep brain stimulation
Glutamate uncage
</ul>
Explanatio

Optogenetics allows researchers to deal with causal interventions in the mammalian brain through genetically expressing actuators that control neuronal activity. One can use powerful mouse genetics and decide which cells to stimulate or to inhibit. Moreover, these actuators are under optical control, and can be turned on and off with millisecond temporal resolution.

Question 2 (1/1 point)

What is channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)?
ChR2 is a light-sensitive G-protein coupled receptor
ChR2 is a light-sensitive cation channel ChR2 is a light-sensitive cation channel - correct
ChR2 is a light-sensitive anion channel
ChR2 is a light-sensitive tyrosine kinase
</ul>
Explanatio

ChR2 is a light-sensitive cation channel. Light is absorbed by covalently bound retinal, generating a structural change in the ChR2 protein conformation, increasing its open probability.

Question 3 (1/1 point)

What happens if we express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in excitatory neurons of mouse whisker motor cortex (wM1) and excite with blue light?
Mouse closes its eyes
Mouse starts rythmic exploratory whisking Mouse starts rythmic exploratory whisking - correct
Mouse begins grooming its whisker pad
Nothing happens
</ul>
Explanatio

Blue light stimulates the motor cortex, and ~30 ms later, the mouse begins to move its whiskers in an exploratory way, rythmically scanning its immediate environment.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

Which approach fails to reversibly inhibit activity in a local region of the mouse brain?
Expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in inhibitory neurons and thereby driving local inhibition
Expressing halorhodopsin (NpHR) in excitatory neurons to optically hyperpolarise them
Expressing archaerhodopsin (Arch) in excitatory neurons to optically hyperpolarise them
Making a lesion in the brain Making a lesion in the brain - correct
</ul>
Explanatio

Lesions are irreversible and have limited spatial precision.

Question 5 (1 point possible)

Why might a light-gated anion channel be better at inhibiting neuronal activity than the light-driven transporters halorhodopsin (NpHR) or archaerhodopsin (Arch)?
Channels can move more ions per second than transporters
Channels do not induce shunting inhibition
Channels have higher ionic selectivity
All of the above All of the above - correct
</ul>
Explanatio

Channels can move more ions per second than transporters. Channels would induce shunting inhibition, and this would further enhance inhibition. Channels do not in general have higher ion selectivity than transporters.
