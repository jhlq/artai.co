Question 1 (1/1 point)

Which statement about the relation between man and mouse is correct?
There is little genetic similarity between man and mouse
Reptiles are genetically closer to man than mouse
The human genome has approximately ten times more genes than the mouse genome
Approximately 99% of genes coding for proteins have homologs comparing man and mouse Approximately 99% of genes coding for proteins have homologs comparing man and mouse - correct

Explanation

In the context of evolution, mouse and man are close to each other, compared to man vs birds / reptiles. In terms of the genes that code for proteins, about 99 percent of genes that are found in man have homologs in mouse.

Question 2 (1/1 point)

Size is the most obvious difference between the brain of a mouse and that of a man. What are their relative sizes?
Mouse: length ~1 cm, volume ~1 ml; Man: length ~100 cm, volume ~1000 l
Mouse: length ~1 cm, volume ~1 ml; Man: length ~10 cm, volume ~1 l Mouse: length ~1 cm, volume ~1 ml; Man: length ~10 cm, volume ~1 l - correct
Mouse: length ~0.1 cm, volume ~0.001 ml; Man: length ~10 cm, volume ~1 l
Mouse: length ~0.1 cm, volume ~0.001 ml; Man: length ~100 cm, volume ~1000 l

Explanation

The mouse brain has a length of ~1 cm, and thus a volume of ~1 cm^3 = ~1 ml. The human brain has a length of ~10 cm, and thus a volume of ~10 x 10 x 10 = ~1000 cm^3 = ~1 l.

Question 3 (1/1 point)

What would be a very rough estimate for the total number of neurons in man and mouse?
100 thousand for mouse and 100 million for man
100 million for mouse and 100 billion for man 100 million for mouse and 100 billion for man - correct
100 thousand for mouse and 1 million for man
100 thousand for mouse and 100 billion for man

Explanation

A typical mouse brain is ~1 cm, weighs ~1 gram, and has ~100 million neurons present in it. If the human brain is roughly 1000 times larger, then we would expect 100 billion neurons in the human brain.

Question 4 (1/1 point)

Imagine that each neuron in the brain synaptically connects to 1,000 other neurons. Using the rough numbers of neurons from the question above, what would be the ratio of the numbers of synapses comparing man and mouse?
Man would have 1 million times more synapses than a mouse
Man would have 1 thousand times more synapses than a mouse Man would have 1 thousand times more synapses than a mouse - correct
Man would have 1 billion times more synapses than a mouse
Man and mouse would have the same number of synapses

Explanation

If man's brain is a thousand times larger than the mouse brain, and the neurons in man and mouse have similar connectivity with 1,000 other neurons, then man's brain would have 1 thousand times more synapses.

Man: 100,000,000,000 * 1,000 = 10^14

Mouse: 100,000,000 * 1,000 = 10^11

The ratio of the number of different patterns of connectivity is however much larger.

Question 5 (1/1 point)

Which neural circuits are similar in man and mouse?
Visual, tactile, gustatory and auditory information flow through the thalamus to the neocortex
Neocortex sends long-range excitatory glutamatergic signals to other brain areas
Cerebellar circuits help fine-scale sensorimotor coordination.
All of the above. All of the above. - correct

Explanation

The overall organising principles of man and mouse brain appear to have many similarities.
