QUESTION 1  (1/1 point)
What are the approximate dimensions of dendrites of typical neurons in the mammalian brain?

 Length ~500 µm and Diameter ~1 µm Length ~500 µm and Diameter ~1 µm - correct  Length ~10 µm and Diameter ~10 nm  Length ~500 µm and Diameter ~10 nm  Length ~10 µm and Diameter ~1 µm
EXPLANATION

The length of a dendrite from the cell body (soma) to the tip typically ranges from ~100 µm to a few mm. The radius of a dendrite typically ranges from a few hundred nanometers to a few micrometers.

QUESTION 2  (1/1 point)
What directly determines the membrane potential at any given time and location in a neuron?

 Transmembrane current flux  Distribution of charges across the membrane Distribution of charges across the membrane - correct  Axial current flow  Concentration of ions
EXPLANATION

The membrane potential is caused by the electrostatic field generated by differential charge density distribution across the plasma membrane, which has complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Across any given area of membrane, the local value of the membrane potential is given by the local charge density divided by the capacitance (following the standard equation for an electrical capacitor Q = CV).

QUESTION 3  (1/1 point)
What do we learn about a dendrite if we know it's "length constant"?

 Thickness of the dendrite  Axial resistance of the dendrite  Spatial attenuation of voltage along the dendrites at steady state Spatial attenuation of voltage along the dendrites at steady state - correct  Length of the dendrite
EXPLANATION

The length constant of a cylindrical cable dendrite is given by the square root of the membrane resistance divided by the axial resistance for a given length of dendrite.

The membrane resistance for a given length of dendrite is generally given in units of Ohm.m (the longer the dendrite, the lower the membrane resistance).

The axial resistance for a given length of dendrite is generally given in units of Ohm/m (the longer the dendrite, the greater the axial resistance).

The voltage attenuation at steady state across the length of the dendritic cable is described by an exponential decay with this length constant.

QUESTION 4  (1/1 point)
If we inject a subthreshold current pulse into the soma, what would we observe in recordings of membrane potential at the soma and at a distal dendrite?

 The membrane potential changes would be faster and larger in the dendrite.  The membrane potential changes would be slower and smaller in the dendrite. The membrane potential changes would be slower and smaller in the dendrite. - correct  The membrane potential changes would be identical in the soma and dendrite.  It is not possible to evaluate without more information.
EXPLANATION

The membrane potential changes would be slower and smaller in the dendrite. It would take some time to fill the capacitance of the dendritic membrane and for the axial currents to propagate. There would also be some leak of axial current across the ion channels present in dendrites. There would therefore be a drop in voltage going away from the injection site in the soma and there would be some temporal filtering.

Note that there is much less filtering of the voltage signal propagating out from the soma into the dendrites, compared to the very extensive filtering of voltage signals coming from the dendrites to the soma. Think about the large surface area (and capacitance) of the soma compared to the thin dendrites.

QUESTION 5  (1/1 point)
When studying the cable properties of two different dendrites, what does it mean that Dendrite 1 has a smaller time constant than Dendrite 2?

 For a given current pulse injection, Dendrite 2 needs less time to reach steady state membrane potential than Dendrite 1  For a given current pulse injection, Dendrite 1 needs less time to reach steady state membrane potential than Dendrite 2 For a given current pulse injection, Dendrite 1 needs less time to reach steady state membrane potential than Dendrite 2 - correct  Dendrite 2 has a lower membrane resistance than Dendrite 1  Dendrite 2 has a lower membrane capacitance than Dendrite 1
EXPLANATION

The time constant is a parameter that provides information about how fast the membrane potential changes in response to current injection. It is defined through the exponential charging of the membrane capacitance equation, as the amount of time it takes for the change in potential to reach 63% of its final steady state value. The lower the time constant, the faster the change of in voltage. The time constant is a function of two membrane properties, the membrane resistance and membrane capacitance. The lower the membrane resistance and membrane capacitance, the faster the membrane time constant.

QUESTION 6  (1/1 point)
When studying the cable properties of two different axons, what does it mean that Axon 1 has a smaller length constant than Axon 2?

 Axon 2 needs less time to reach a given membrane potential than Axon 1  Axon 1 needs less time to reach a given membrane potential than Axon 2  In Axon 2 a change in membrane potential decays more rapidly with distance than in Axon 1  In Axon 2 a change in membrane potential decays less with distance than in Axon 1 In Axon 2 a change in membrane potential decays less with distance than in Axon 1 - correct
EXPLANATION

The length constant is a parameter that is used to quantify the distance that a voltage will extend across an axon or dendrite at steady state. The greater the value of the length constant, the further the voltage will spread and vice versa. The voltage attenuation along the length of a cylindrical cable is governed by an exponential decay function with this length constant. In particular, if you have a length constant of 1 mm, that means at 1 mm away from the cell body in an axon, 37% of the voltage remains at steady state.
